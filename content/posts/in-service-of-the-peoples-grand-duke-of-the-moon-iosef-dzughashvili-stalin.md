Happy [GLOGtober](https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html), which never ended in our hearts! Here's some expansion content for [Red Air](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/red-air.html), which is only GLOG by virtue of having been written by a GLOGblin (me), but that'll have to do.

Specifically, this is sort of an intro adventure. Hopefully this does something to patch the holes in the original document (what plane do you start with, what are you supposed to _do_, et cetera). It took about three sessions, I think, when I playtested it.

It's pretty linear, which I think is forgivable for an intro adventure but still not great. My apologies, and please take any assumed actions only as what _my_ players did. You are empowered, go forth and GM.

**Content warning**: There are Space Nazis in this post.

Sky Knights, Assemble
---------------------

[Opening theme.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn2YF_gvCfE)

  

We open the game on the party, a gang of rookie Cosmonaut-Starshyna, completing their training at the Academy, deep in the wilderness of frozen Siberia. **Training-Commissar Balto,** their erstwhile mentor, sheds a single tear of pride as he pins their basic training medals on their fresh new uniforms and leads them to their planes—a **Polikarpov I-150 Albatross biplane** for each graduate, fully aetherized and equipped with **4x 7.62x54mm PV-1 machine guns**.

> **Polikarpov I-150 Albatross biplane**
> 
> **\- ****HP** 30  
> **\- ****Armor** none  
> **\- ****Speed** +0  
> **\- ****Handling** +1

> **Equipment (20/30)**

> **4x 7.62mm PV-1 machine gun**  
> **\- Accuracy** +4  
> **\- ****Damage** 5d8  
> **\- ****Ammo** 12  
> **\- ****AP** Light Vehicle  
> **\- ****Size** 5/ea

The training-commissar also produces an official-looking sealed letter and hands it to whoever's been established as the 'leader' of the group (the **bureaucrat**, if they have one), containing their first set of **orders:** They are being posted to the **People’s Republic of the Moon** to oversee and guard **People’s Grand Duke of the Moon Iosef Dzughashvili Stalin**’s moon serfs—the material conditions of the moon don’t yet allow for state capitalism, so Stalin has undertaken a campaign of rapid feudalization—against vague and scattered reports of banditry while they work the Helium-3 mines.

To the Moon
-----------

The journey to the moon is [quiet and uneventful](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLi5_3p7hh8), only broken by a brief radio communication from the People's Earth Defense Satellites as the party breaks out of the atmosphere—querying for their Cosmonaut-Starshyna IFF codes (which are helpfully printed out and pasted to their radio consoles).

Upon arriving, they are brought before the **Commandant of the Lunar Stasi,** **Comrade Conrad Griegoriev** (Secret Police Lieutenant stats, an anxious-looking man in his mid-50’s with angular features and a nasty cough, he moves stiffly) who welcomes them to the moon and details the problems facing the Helium-3 mines as well as the party’s **task: **

A number of months ago, an entire 200-strong work party of Moon Serfs sent to begin construction of a new mine disappeared without trace. Since then, mining facilities and work parties have been harried by mysterious assailants both airborne (in unmarked light fighters) and on foot. **Griegoriev**, for his part, suspects the initial missing work party of escaping to the subsurface lunar caves and turning to banditry. His main concern, of course, is production—his mines are far below quota, and he can only falsify reports for so long before it will come to the attention of the **People’s Grand Duke.** He tells the party that their assignment is to **fly overwatch for the next work party**, which departed earlier that same day to restart construction on the same site where the first group went missing, and welcomes them to help themselves to the **moonbase’s limited armory**.

The armory is sparsely stocked, but anyone who neglected to bring a weapon can find a **Simonov Cosmonaut Carbine (Dmg** 2d8 **AP** Light personal**)** in relatively poor but workable condition. Adjacent to the armory is the moonbase’s hangar, where they will find their planes being loaded and refueled for whenever they are ready to set out. The hangar is likewise poorly stocked, but at least has ample **fuel**, **ammunition**, and **7.62mm machine guns (Acc **+1/gun, **Dmg **5d8, **Amm **12, **AP **Light vehicle, **Size** 5**)** to re-arm (or up-arm) planes with if necessary. The moonbase has no actual planes of its own, which is why the Sky Knights were dispatched there in the first place.

This would also be a good time for any **workers** among the party to upgrade their planes—allow them to increase each plane's **speed** or **handling** by one or **HP** (and thus equipment slots) by five, as well as fit any additional machine guns they want to (the lattermost of which can be done even if the party contains no **workers**).

**If the party bothers to investigate further at the moonbase before departing:** While there is certainly unrest among the moon serfs, nobody has heard of any resistance movement nor had any contact with the disappeared workers suggesting they might have started one or were planning to escape. The Lunar Stasi do, however, have some vague and half-formed suspicions that there may be Trotskyite or Maoist agents about.

First Watch
-----------

Upon departing on their mission (the moon-serf work party departed earlier, as mentioned, since they move much slower than aetherized warplanes, and are expected to reach the work site at the same time): The party flies over the barren lunar landscape, the shining atmos-globes and gold-plated onion domes of the moonbase slowly disappearing behind them. The radio crackles once as they cross the day-night barrier to the dark side of the moon; it’s **Griegoriev**, calling to wish them good luck and give them a series of frequencies (six, if it matters) to contact the work party on. After that, it goes dead—the moonbase is out of range now, beyond the curvature of the moon’s horizon, and all that can be heard on this side is Radio Free Marx broadcasting [patriotic music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BQbpV6DQgI) on hyper-wave bandwidths from across the solar system.

As they come up on their station, the radio remains dead. Cycling through the frequencies they were given, only the fifth yields any response: A panicked cry for help, followed by a deafening hiss of static—something has gone terribly wrong.

Approaching the site yields a vision of the area scattered with debris and the corpses of moon-serfs, the remainder fleeing panicked on foot in bulky silver space suits that reflect the light of the planes' spotlights from the wreckage of their mining vehicles and equipment. Circling in the sky over the site and attempting to hunt down the fleeing serfs are a flight of light fighters with markings illegible from this distance and at this speed. As the party approaches, the fighters turn and reform in a passable wedge to attack!

Encounter: <_N = party size_\> Fighters, two rounds out
-------------------------------------------------------

> **Enemy Pilots:**   
> Rookie Pilots, **HP** 10, **Gun** +2 **Pil** +2 **Tac** \-1  
> \- Basic flight suit and breather helmet, Luger P.80 **Dmg** 1d8 **AP** \-

> **Enemy Planes:  
> **Messerschmitt BF-1009, **HP** d20+20(each), **Light armor**, **Spd** +4 (Ttl +6), **Hdl** +2 (Ttl +4)  
> \- 4x 7.92mm machine gun, **Acc** +4 (Ttl +6), **Dmg** 5d8, **Amm** 12, **AP** Light vehicle

Once the party has successfully shot one down, they are able to get a closer look at the markings as the unfortunate pilot spirals down to impact the lunar surface:

**_NAZIS FROM THE DARK SIDE OF THE MOON!_**

The moon serfs are thoroughly shellshocked, and continue to flee despite the moon nazis having been shot down. If the party is inclined to round them up, they’ll have a hard time of it (unless they’re a **bureaucrat** and have some method of broadcasting their voice—perhaps a megaphone? The moon serfs’ spacesuits are extremely basic and don’t contain radios). The moon serfs are not eager to return to their life of drudgery, abuse, and reeducation through labor, especially after having been shot at.

Back to the Moonbase
--------------------

Upon returning to the moonbase, the party is greeted by a hyperventilating and clearly hysteric **Commandant Griegoriev.** He (fanning himself, almost fainting) thanks them for shooting down the fighters but as he begins to calm down is increasingly incredulous at the reports that they were the ancient patriotic enemy, nazis. In fact if the party didn’t bring any evidence and doesn’t have a **bureaucrat** (or has one that isn’t interested or trying very hard) he won’t believe them at all, with possibly disastrous consequences. If **Griegoriev** has his way, work will continue and they’ll send out another party to build the site, this time with armed guards and the party flying overwatch the whole way there. They can, of course, convince him otherwise.

While the party is still at the moonbase, they are approached by a **shifty-looking gentleman** in a long coat with a sharply-pointed goatee and a flatcap. In a hushed voice he tells them that he needs to speak with them urgently, and (should they go along with him) ushers them into an underground **[speakeasy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYdgKHa2KbI)**; a dingy moon-cave under a hab-flat where trotskyists and other malcontents plot beneath Stalin’s moonbase. Someone tries to sell them a newspaper. A keen-eyed skyknight (**DC 10** roll, **+2** if anyone can explain why they’d be good at judging patrons of shady establishments OR identifying disparate communist subsects) will notice that there’s a self-portrait of **Frida Kahlo** on a wall, but someone over there has a **Little Red Book** in their breast pocket and a few of the other patrons are almost certainly undercover lunar stasi agents. This place is a powder keg.

The shifty-looking man introduces himself as **Major Juarez Garcia**, an agent of the Red Army Military Commissariat (a **Trotskyist** faction), and tells the party he has learned of their report through his conspirators in the Commandant’s retinue. He tells them that unlike the traitorous and incompetent **Commandant Griegoriev** he believes them implicitly, but that he sees in these happenings (if they are interested) a possible opportunity for the true friends of the revolution to destabilize or even seize power from the Stalinist wreckers currently in command of the moonbase.

**Juarez** details his plan: The party should return to **Griegoriev**, convince him he is correct and their services are no longer needed, and that the work parties will be fine. Meanwhile, they should investigate the moon nazis on their own, with the support of he and his (Trotskyist) Red Army loyalists. Once they have uncovered the moon nazi base, they will be suited to publicize it and discredit Stalin and the Lunar Stasi in the eyes of the people.

After doing this, **Juarez** takes his leave. Simultaneously on the far side of the speakeasy, they hear voices raised in anger. A **burly Maoist with full-body tattoos** (his name is **Red Viper**, if approached after the fight) drops a little red book, a punch is thrown—a bar fight breaks out. The deep-cover lunar stasi agents draw their pistols and attempt to make arrests, causing a three-way standoff: Trotskyists, Maoists, and Stalin’s lunar stasi all pointing handguns at each other from behind hurriedly kicked-over tables. The party have a chance to make their allegiances clear.

Encounter: <_N = party size_\> each Lunar Stasi, Trotskyist Agitators, and Maoist Moon Guerillas
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Every line agent for each side shares the same statblock:  
**Lunar Stasi Agent, Trotskyist Agitator, or Maoist Moon Guerilla, **HP **10, **Gun **+2 **Pil **\-2 **Tac **+2  
\- Civilian clothes, Tokarev TT-3000 AP Pistol **Dmg **2d8 **AP **Light Personal

**The Lunar Stasi are led by:**  
Hauptmann **Sev Harper**, **HP** 19, **Gun** +3 **Pil** +0 **Tac** +3  
\- Civilian clothes, Makarov Ray Pistol **Dmg **4d8 **AP **Light Vehicle  

**The Maoist Moon Guerillas are led by:**

\- Worker's jumpsuit, Tokarev TT-3000 AP Pistol **Dmg **2d8 **AP **Light Personal  

The Trotskyist Agitators have no notable leader present, **Juarez** having already made his exit.

Once the situation is defused (whether by negotiation—difficult, even for a **bureaucrat**—or by all agents of two of the three factions becoming incapacitated or dead), the party has a chance to speak with the survivors.

**

**The Next Mission**
--------------------

**

**If the party sided with the Lunar Stasi, took advantage of the chaos to escape but intend to keep working with Griegoriev, or never went to the speakeasy in the first place,** they will be expected to escort a second work party—this time with a ground-based armed escort.

After a day spent repairing and refitting while the next work party is outfitted (during which time replacement planes and Sky Knights can be requisitioned from Cosmonaut-Starshyna HQ, if they took any losses) the group sets out, successfully reaching the work site where the ground escort has already set up their defenses (two aetherized ZSU-23-4 antiaircraft vehicles) and excavation is beginning. They will fly patrol for approximately one hour before a similar force to the first they faced (_<N = party size>_ moon nazi fighters) approaches and makes an assault.

> **Allies:**   
> Lunar Guard, **HP **10, **Gun **+2 **Pil **+2 **Tac **\-1  
> \- Armored spacesuit (10 HP), Mosin-Nagant M2001 Rifle **Dmg **3d8 **AP** Medium personal
> 
> ZSU-23-4 Shilka SPAAG, **HP **40, **Light armor**, **Spd/Hdl** 0 (automatically fails evasion)  
> \- 4x 23mm autocannon, **Acc **+2 (Ttl +4), **Dmg **7d8, **Amm **6, **AP** Medium vehicle

> Rookie Pilots, **HP **10, **Gun **+2 **Pil **+2 **Tac **\-1

> \- 4x 7.92mm machine gun, **Acc **+4 (Ttl +6), **Dmg **5d8, **Amm **12, **AP **Light vehicle

Should they succeed in fighting off this second assault, **Griegoriev** will be forced to accept their testimony—backed up by that of the Lunar Guard, if any survive—that the enemy they face is, in fact, moon nazis, and that their headquarters must be rooted out and destroyed.

**If ****the party ****sided with the Trotskyists and/or agreed to work with Juarez,** they are ushered to a safehouse where **Juarez** waits to reiterate his offer: If they can convince **Griegoriev** that their services are no longer needed and that the ground-based escort will suffice to defend the work party against any bandits (this is not true, but easy to convince him of), then **Juarez** and his Trotskyist agitators will assist them in locating the moon-nazi headquarters discreetly.

The Trotskyists have infiltrated Stalin's Lunar Guard sufficiently to, with the aid of the party's pull as Cosmonauts-Starshyna, be able to offer the same services as **Griegoriev** did.

**If ****the party**** sided with Red Viper and his Moon Maoist Guerillas and tell them of their discovery,** they are invited to make their escape to a guerilla camp just over the horizon on the dark side of the moon, to plot their search for and eventual assault on the moon nazi headquarters—which **Red Viper** is interested in accomplishing independently for similar reasons to those explained to the party by **Juarez** earlier.

The Maoist guerilla camp is a spartan affair of prefab buildings and inflatable domes, but does include a hangar capable of servicing and rearming the party's planes and an armory stocked with similar weapons to those formerly available to them in Stalin's moonbase.

Searching for the Moon Nazi Headquarters
----------------------------------------

A search radius for the prospective location of the base is easily plotted, based on extrapolations from the fuel capacity of Great Patriotic War-era Bf-109s, the predecessor to the moon nazi fighters the party faced earlier. Once determined, it will be a simple matter for the party to [fly a search pattern across the area](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Tq03vn0MK0). Of course, the moon nazis may have patrols in the air, having doubtless reported the party's thwarting of their previous attack(s) on the work parties...

Players might decide to fly extremely low or approach from space, in which case these patrols can be avoided at the cost of the search taking longer—possibly requiring multiple sorties. If in doubt, fall back on a **Tactics** roll (**DC 10**) from whoever came up with the plan.

If the party does not come up with a plan to avoid patrols, they will encounter one shortly before discovering the moon nazi base: Another **_<N = party size>_ Bf-1009 fighters**, this time backed up by a single **Heinkel He-1977 long-range bomber** fitted for escort and patrol duty, two rounds out as before.

> **Enemy Pilots:**   
> Rookie Pilots, **HP **10, **Gun **+2 **Pil **+2 **Tac **\-1  
> \- Basic flight suit and breather helmet, Luger P.80 **Dmg **1d8 **AP **\-

> **Enemy Planes:   
> **Messerschmitt BF-1009, **HP **20(/40), **Light armor**, **Spd **+4 (Ttl +6), **Hdl **+2 (Ttl +4)  
> \- 4x 7.92mm machine gun, **Acc **+4 (Ttl +6), **Dmg **5d8, **Amm **12, **AP **Light vehicle

> Heinkel He-1977, **HP** 60(/120), **Light armor**, **Spd** -2 (Ttl +0), **Hdl** -2 (Ttl +0)  
> \- 2x 20mm cannon (turret, forward arc), **Acc **+1 (Ttl +3), **Dmg **7d8, **Amm **6, **AP **Medium vehicle  
> \- 2x 7.92mm machine gun (turret, rear arc), **Acc **+2 (Ttl +4), **Dmg **5d8, **Amm **12, **AP **Light vehicle

These patrolling Bf-1009s are fitted with automated recovery systems, allowing shot-down planes to descend slowly and in more or less one piece to the lunar surface. An enterprising Sky Knight might be able to persuade their contacts to send a recovery party, if they want a new plane.

[![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RS809niXr_k/X6kAsPCmAEI/AAAAAAAAqdU/h_2D9tlzn88AP_2AsxC0Zj3Jfhv_1HlEACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h266/image.png "evilmoonbase")](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RS809niXr_k/X6kAsPCmAEI/AAAAAAAAqdU/h_2D9tlzn88AP_2AsxC0Zj3Jfhv_1HlEACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png)

Regardless of whether a patrol is avoided, or encountered and defeated, the way is clear for the rest of the party's search. The moon nazi headquarters is quickly found thereafter, nestled away in a lunar crater. Should the party report it in to their contact (whoever that might be, at this point), they will be recalled to ready themselves for the assault.

Assault on the Moon Nazi Headquarters
-------------------------------------

Upon the party's return, their contact will have assembled what forces are available to them—a column of venerable T-34 tanks aetherized for lunar combat, and a regiment of Lunar Guard, Trotskyist Red Army, or Maoist Moon Guerillas. A small force, but they're confident it will be sufficient to assault the nazi moonbase. Also present are two aetherized Antonov An-2022 heavy transport aircraft, which will serve double duty in hauling T-34s on lunar sleds which should let the force travel at maximum speed and take the enemy by surprise.

Once everyone has been briefed and planes have been refueled, repaired, and rearmed, the forces move on the moon nazi headquarters and [the assault begins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENyxseq59YQ).

The lunarized T-34s are released, sled-conveyances skidding towards the gates of the swastika fortress as they open fire. The An-2022s circle low behind the rim of the crater, disgorging low-altitude jump infantry who bound to cover and add supporting fire with their rifles. The party's planes loop and whirl over the battlefield, engaging moon-nazi fighters as they are disgorged from the base's hangars before they can gain altitude to fire back. A triumphant cheer erupts on comms channels as the massive steel gates of the fortress are blown open by the tanks, before...

A Wrench in the Gears
---------------------

The center dome of the fortress opens, steel petals irising into the concrete walls, and a hundred-ton mechanical titan erupts upwards atop a pillar of smoke and fire with the word "Totenkopf" emblazoned on its chest in Fraktur gothic. Spinning in mid-ascension, it unleashes dozens of missiles which corkscrew crazily outward, one of them catching the wing of a transport plane and sending it spiralling to the ground. Landing heavily amidst the assault force, it lifts one massive cannon-adorned arm and strafes the tank column. The party's contact's voice crackles over their radios, calling for a retreat.

The tanks managed to breach the fortress gates before they were taken out, so there's a way in, but a frontal assault is no longer possible. An elite team of Cosmonaut-Starshyna will have to infiltrate the base and find a way to deactivate it: Fortunately, there's exactly one of those present.
