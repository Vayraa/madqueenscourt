Happy [GLOGtober](https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html)!

Definitions and Etymology
=========================

So, the term "adventure". It doesn't normally - in real life - mean walking into a tomb and killing (or being killed by) skeletons, getting treasure, all the things we expect from a tabletop RPG "adventure". It really just means, like, going somewhere. The _going_, that's the adventure, the exciting part. What you do when you actually get there is just... Work, usually. Sometimes hanging out. With the _bros_. But usually just work.

_This image disagrees with me, but fuck it. It doesn't know_ anything_. It's just an image._

I forget where I was going with that. 

You know who goes on adventures? Rangers. And you know what you need for adventures? Hooks.  

It all _fits together,_ don't you _see_?

Ranger Made of Hooks
====================

**1/A: Bushcraft, Ankomorph**  
**2/B: Trailblazing, Wilderness Lore  
****3/C: Barbs, Ranging, Fishhook  
****4/D: Ambush, Skyhook**

**A: Bushcraft**You have **skill** in **bushcraft**, and can easily make mundane objects out of natural resources such as sticks, rocks, and plant matter which function nearly as well as professionally made versions. This takes **ten minutes** for anything portable (torches, a short rope, snares, spears, etc), or **one hour** for vehicles or structures (shelters, pit traps, rafts, sledges, etc). This isn't infinite free gear - you and your GM should work together to describe what exactly you do to make whatever things you're making - but it is as much free gear and as _good_ of free gear as is _possible_.

**A: Ankomorph  
**In place of flesh, your body is comprised of thousands upon thousands of iron fishhooks, knotted together into barbed, twisting appendages in rough facsimile of an orcish or goblinoid form. This renders you immune to most concerns of fleshier beings such as disease and poison, although you do still require sustenance and have to be wary of rust and lodestones. Their natural hardness gives you **4 AC **that doesn't stack with armor, and your **unarmed attacks** and successful **grapple** checks deal **1d6 **base damage.

**B: Trailblazing**  
You have **skill** in **tracking** and **pathfinding**. Yourself and your party are not slowed by rough terrain during overland travel.

**B: Wilderness Lore**  
When encountering a strange plant or animal for the first time, you have a **2-in-6** chance of identifying them. When encountering a condition (a disease, poison, curse, enchantment, etc) for the first time, you have a **2-in-6** chance of knowing of a strange plant or animal that could affect that condition in some way (causing it, curing it, immunizing against it, etc). When learning of or entering a notable location for the first time, you have a **2-in-6** chance of deducing an **adventure hook** or **rumor** with at least one true element for that location from context clues and prior information. These chances improve by **1-in-6** per Ranger Made of Hooks template, to a maximum of **4-in-6** at template D.

**C: Barbs**  
When you successfully hit with an **unarmed attack**, you can make another **unarmed attack** against the same target with no penalty and without spending an **action**. This continues until you miss.

**C: Ranging**  
Your first random encounter each day always includes, contains, or consists of the following, _in some form_:  
**Dense vegetation (forest, plain, savanna, jungle):** Enough food and water for your entire party.  
**Sparse vegetation (desert, steppe, tundra, scrubland):** Enough food and water for yourself and four others.  
**No vegetation (dungeon, glacier, salt flat):** Enough food and water for you.

**C: Fishhook**  
You have, somehow, acquired a fish friend. It is a [giant cave pike](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-c-is-for-cave-beasts-companions.html), who despite its ill temper and tiny brain considers you its best pal in the entire world and will do its best to defend you. It possesses a preternatural ability to find you if and when you abandon it, and will do so eventually even if slain. Or maybe that's a different fish, then. Hard to tell.

**D: Ambush**  
When you begin an encounter and aren't **surprised**, you may retroactively decide where to have placed yourself and any members of your party that agree to follow your direction. At least one member must be visible and out of hiding.

**D: Skyhook**  
Your hooks reverberate with minute variations in frequency, allowing you to predict what the next change in the weather will be by standing outside and concentrating for one minute.
