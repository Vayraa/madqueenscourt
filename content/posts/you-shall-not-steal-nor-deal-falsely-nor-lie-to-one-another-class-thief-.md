A Thief, in the style of my [Fighter](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html), I suppose.

> _Not recognizing anyone’s right to judge me, I don’t ask for either pardon or indulgence. I don’t go begging to those I hate and hold in contempt. You are the stronger. Dispose of me as you wish; send me to a penal colony or the scaffold. I don’t care! But before going our separate ways, let me tell you one last thing:_

Class: Ultimate Thief

Every template of Thief you have gives you **+1 to sneaking**, **stealing**, and **saves**. Your second and fourth templates also each give you **+1 to-hit**. If you're playing in a system with **proficiency**, you have it in **light** armor and any type of weapon that can be both wielded in one hand and concealed under a light jacket.

**Skills:** Stealth and **see template A**.

**Starting Equipment:** A **knife**, a **light weapon** of your choice and **ammunition** for it if applicable, a **thieves tool**, **dark clothing**, a **bullseye lantern** and **oil**, **soft boots**, and a **cloak**.

**A** Scraps, Skilled, Stolen Fortunes  
**B** Connected, Hidden Pockets, +1 Skill, +1 FD  
**C** Opportunist, +1 Skill, +1 FD  
**D** Shadow, +1 Skill, +1 FD

**A: Scraps**  
A life spent eating scraps and fleeing from the cops has left you frail and sickly, giving you **\-1 HP** per **HD.**  
  
**A: Skilled**  
A thief lives or dies by their skills, and by surviving this long you've already picked up a much broader repertoire than most adventurers—as well as some special tricks. **Twice** upon gaining this template as well as **once** for each thief template thereafter, gain a skill from the list downbelow. In addition, you gain the **special ability** from the list for each skill on it that you have.

**A: Stolen Fortunes**  
You have a pool of **Fortune Dice**, or **FD**, which are **d4**s equal to the number of thief templates you have. You can roll any number of these when you roll a **d20**, and add them to the result. **FD** that come up a result less than or equal to the number of **FD** you rolled are expended until you get a good long rest, otherwise they return to your pool.

**B: Connected**  
Whatever organization, underworld, community, or creed you belong to is connected to people and places everywhere, and there are signs by which you may recognize and be recognized as a part of the same. When you roll a natural **7** on a **reaction** roll, reroll it and the encounter is in some way connected to your background.

**B:** **Hidden Pockets**  
You have **\[templates\]** extra inventory slots. Items you store in them can't be found by anyone unless you want them to.

**C: Opportunist**  
When fighting an opponent who can't pay full attention to you—because they've got sand or sun in their eyes, they're being flanked, you yelled "hey what's that over there" and they're an idiot, &c—your attacks deal **double** damage.

**D: Shadow**  
You can **vanish** in shadows, do loud things (running, fighting, breaking stuff) **very** quietly, and do quiet things (walking, climbing, pulling a knife, rummaging around in a backpack) in **absolute** silence.

1d20 Thief Skills

1.  **Locksmithing**  
    When you successfully pick a lock, it's instantaneous. When you fail, it only takes a round.  
      
    
2.  **Jury-rigging**  
    Improvised or makeshift tools and devices function as well as professionally made ones, in your hands.  
      
    
3.  **Climbing**  
    You can climb sheer surfaces as if they were merely difficult, even without gear.  
      
    
4.  **Acrobatics**  
    You can dodge over, around, and effectively _through_ people and person-scale obstacles as if they weren't even there, as long as there's room to do so.  
      
    
5.  **[Burglary](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html)**  
    Given ten minutes per hundred square feet, you can pile everything vaguely saleable - including hidden objects, parts of other objects, et cetera - in the middle of a room.  
      
    
6.  **Appraisal  
    **You can determine the value of objects to within one order of magnitude at a glance, and identify them precisely with between one minute and one hour of study depending on scale.  
      
    
7.  **Forgery**  
    You can forge believable documents, signatures, et cetera without an original to examine, provided you've seen one before or have a halfway decent description to work from.  
      
    
8.  **Disguise**  
    When disguised as someone, you count _as them_ for any magical or metaphysical purposes. If it matters, you can also mimic their iris patterns, fingerprints, blood type, &c.  
      
    
9.  **Forensics**  
    When examining the scene of an event, you can physically _see and hear_ an approximation of how the event played out. This won't necessarily give you any new information, but it will certainly make clues obvious that might otherwise have been missed.  
      
    
10.  **Anatomy**  
    When presented with an unaware subject that possesses a comprehensible anatomy, you can place them in whatever state you desire with a nerve pinch/karate chop/stiff-knuckled jab to the pressure points.  
      
    
11.  **Fast-talking**  
    Potential interlocutors must check **morale** to interrupt or disbelieve you as long as you keep talking. You can speak for a full thirty seconds without running out of breath.  
      
    
12.  **Devices**  
    You can alter or repair **devices** effectively even without appropriate tools. When you **sabotage** a device, you can choose exactly what time or condition under which it will fail and the manner in which it will do so.  
      
    
13.  **Toxicology**  
    You can determine the nature of a poisoning from symptoms without risk of error, and can formulate a reasonably effective poison or antidote from any well-stocked pantry or acre of wilderness.  
      
    
14.  **Linguistics**  
    Through roguish instinct, you know how to say all of the following in any language that you've heard spoken even once:

1.  "I don't want any trouble"
2.  "How can I get _fucked up_ around here?"
3.  "I have the money, if you have the stuff"
4.  "This is \[a\] robbery!"
5.  "That's my wife!"
6.  "COPS!"  
      
    

16.  **Smuggling**  
    Once per locale, you can have had a **connection** smuggle something helpful in for you. The **DM** gets to decide what exactly it is (which you do not know) and where exactly it's placed (which you do).  
      
    
17.  [**Intimidation**](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html)  
    Your threats are always treated as credible and requiring **morale** checks by anything that can understand them. You could bop a dragon on the shin and say "eeeeeehhh nice pile of treasure you got here, be a shame if something happened to it" and they would have to make a **morale** check. Dragons have very, very high **morale** scores, but they still have to make the check.  
      
    
18.  **Fencing**  
    You have a **2-in-6** chance of finding a buyer for stolen goods in any settlement, a **2-in-6** chance of knowing if any given buyer is going to rat you out, and a **2-in-6** chance of disarming your opponent in a flashy _prise de fer_ with the first attack you make in each combat.  
      
    
19.  **Pickpocketing**  
    When someone tries to wield an item you have a **2-in-6** chance of having already stolen it, if you've been within arm's reach of them within the last hour and should so desire.  
      
    
20.  **Drinking**  
    You can identify special properties of beverages accurately by taste. When blackout drunk, you only do **cool** shit, no embarrassing shit, unless it's also super **cool**.  
      
    
21.  **Eavesdropping**  
    When you listen in on a conversation, the participants are **guaranteed** to speak about something of interest to you.

4.  **[Gumshoe Detective](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/11/a-hired-dick-glog-class-thief-guild.html)**

If you didn't already speak **[swordsong](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html)** you do now, and short blades speak more intelligently to you than they do to others.

    Starting Equipment:A **monkey wrench**, an **iron bomb**, three **molotov cocktails**, a **red bandana**, your clothes and lantern and such.  
    Benefit:Given an economy with significant wealth inequality, one hour, and a soapbox to speak from, you can cause significant unrest among the lower classes. Make a **reaction** roll to determine how well you are able to direct their ire.  
    Drawback:**\-2 reaction** with other **revolutionaries** (due to leftist infighting) and **agents of authority** (for obvious reasons) as long as your identity is known. Both of the above will pen screeds and tirades against you and have them delivered to you by messenger.

12.  **Kingnapper**  
    Starting Equipment:A crudely forged **iron dagger**, enough **stout hemp rope** to bind a king, a large (king-sized) **burlap sack**, clothes and lantern and such.  
    Benefit:You can carry **one**securely bound person in a sack as easily as if they were, I don't know, a **3 slot** sack of potatoes.  
    Drawback: You're responsible for the care and feeding of any king you kingnap. Allowing one to die in your care will see you hunted to the ends of the earth.

    Benefit: You can speak [**chew**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html) if you couldn't already, and summon **\[minutes spent chanting\]^2** rats with a secret incantation, up to the number of rats reasonably present wherever you are. They aren't automatically obedient, roll **reaction** as normal.  
    Drawback:The stench of the sewers is permanently upon you, and it is **gross**. If you ever manage to scrub it off, you lose your rat-summoning powers and rats won't talk to you until you get good and grimy again.  
      
    
14.  **Aerialist**  
    Starting Equipment:** 100'** of high-quality silk, assorted **swivels**, **carabiners** and **clips**, an elaborately tasseled **jian**, none of that other trash.  
    Benefit:You weigh about a third as much as you would if you weren't an **aerialist**, and can swing from silks, vines, rigging, kites, and chandeliers like a **monkey**. Treat falls as though they were **20'** shorter than they actually are.  
    Drawback:Hollow bird bones break easily, giving you **\-2 HP** per **HD**.  
      
    
15.  **[Secret](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html) [Agent](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-8th-mysteries-and-baited-hooks.html)**  
    Starting Equipment:A **silenced small-caliber pistol** with **one magazine** and **7 cartridges**, a **nice suit** (+1 **reaction**, not armor), a **nice watch**, a **secret communication device**.  
    Benefit:You can **call for backup** to have a **level** **1** member of your organization with an appropriate class appear from an unlikely hiding spot to assist you with a single task. If you get them killed, Headquarters won't send you another one for **1d6** weeks.  
    Drawback:Your organization will, naturally, give you **tasks** to accomplish in order to further their **interests** in the region.  
      
    
16.  **[Gambler](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html)**  
    Starting Equipment:A **loaded two-shot derringer**, a **straw boater**, a **nice suit** (+1 **reaction**, not armor), a cloak and a lamp and a whatnot.  
    Benefit but also Drawback:When you succeed at a **d20** roll, you can choose to roll it again for **double or nothing**. A success on the second roll upgrades your result to that of a **critical success**, while a failure downgrades it to a **fumble**.  
      
    
17.  **Escape Artist**  
    _The Escape Artist has vanished from the confines of this blogpost. If any of you see it, please let me know.[Lexi](https://crateredland.blogspot.com/) has found the Escape Artist. Here she is:  
    _Starting Equipment:A set of **lockpicks**, a pot of **grease**, a **catsuit** (+1 **reaction** _or_ as **leather**, your choice), an incredibly valuable and even more **incredibly stolen gemstone**, twenty small and worthless **signature trinkets**, none of that other garbage.  
    Benefit:You can squeeze through spaces slightly smaller than your head, and wriggle effortlessly free from **mundane** bonds.  
    Drawback: You are compelled to leave your **signature trinkets** at the scene of every crime or other significant happening, to prove how much better you are than the authorities. You are pursued by a bumbling but persistent **investigator** (perhaps a **gumshoe detective**) who has staked their career and reputation on catching you; should they perish or be fired for their incompetence, you will receive a new one following the next time you leave a **signature trinket** somewhere.  
      
    
18.  **(Disgraced Former) Stage Magician**  
    Starting Equipment:A **nice suit** (+1 **reaction**, not armor), a **very sharp hand-saw**, a **deck of trick playing cards**, a **deck of non-trick playing cards**, a **very tall hat** with a **false bottom**, the **top half of a rabbit**.  
    Benefit: You can cut willing (or unaware) people in half without killing them, which is very impressive.  
    Drawback: **1-in-6** chance you can't put them back together 😳  
     
19.  **Mafioso**  
    Starting Equipment:An **M1921 Thompson Submachine Gun, Caliber .45**, a **drum magazine**, and **100 cartridges**, a **violin case**, a **nice suit** (+1 **reaction**, not armor), a **nice cigar**, none of that other stuff.  
    Benefit: You're part of a _famiglia_, and can scare up **1d6 Little Italian Boys** at a moment's notice plus travel time to and from **Little Italy**.  
    Drawback:**Little Italian Boys** are a rowdy bunch, difficult to direct effectively. Until you've reached template **D** (and become a _capo_), you must answer the call when **1d6 Little Italian Boys** are needed by another **mafioso**.  
      
    
20.  **Shadowdancer**  
    Starting Equipment:You just get the normal stuff, honestly.  
    Benefit:You can step into any **shadow** and out of any other within a stone's throw (that you can see).  
    Drawback:When you step through a **shadow** you have an **X-in-6** chance of losing a random item, where **X** is the number of times you've stepped through **shadows** that day. You don't cast a **shadow **of your own.
