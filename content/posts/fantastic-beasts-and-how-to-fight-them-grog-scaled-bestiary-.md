Some folks are, against my counsel, running [the GROG (my gloghack)](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html) for their own purposes.

This means I should probably do up some sort of minimal "Monster Manual", since the GROG uses bigger numbers than more directly-descended-from-B/X-and-the-like OSR systems.  
  
So, here you go. Some monster stat chassis to build on.

**Pissant** (goblin, peasant, skeleton, cultist, dog, etc)  
**HD** 1 **HP** 4 **AC** 10 (unarmored)  
**Attack** +0 light melee weapon 1d6+0  
A goblin or kobold might be **Size** small and have **DEX** +1, giving them **AC** 12 and +1 to hit  
A guard or tradesfolk might have **STR** +1, giving them **HP** 5 and +1 to hit and damage  
Some might carry medium weapons which deal 1d8, or ranged weapons, or wear light armor  

**Combatant** (orc, zombie, wolf, soldier, giant spider, etc)  
**HD** 2 **HP** 11 **AC** 12 (light armor)  
**STR** +1   
**Attack** +3 medium melee weapon 1d8+1  
An orc might have **STR** +2, giving them **HP** 13 and a further +1 to hit and damage  
A zombie might have no bonus to hit from HD, reducing their attack bonus to +1  
Some might carry other weapons, or wear heavier armor
