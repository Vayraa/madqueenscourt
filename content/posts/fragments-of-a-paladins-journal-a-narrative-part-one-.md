**December 6th, 1848**

Have chosen to keep this journal in order to chronicle my deeds, that others may learn from my methods and be convinced not to sin. Should you find this in the lair of some Wizard, know that I am the Paladin sometimes called **Carrack**, after the vessel of war.

My interest in the life and actions of **Patton Klohr** has only grewn these past years, having studied intently the final letters sent from his original party as they descended. I shall make my way southward in the coming weeks. I am sure they will welcome my company should I arrive before they perish.
