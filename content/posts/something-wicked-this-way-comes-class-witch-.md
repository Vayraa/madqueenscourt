Alright, buckle the fuck up, this is a long one. This isn't a simplified **classis**, like the [Fighter](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html) or the [Thief](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html). This is a whole-ass Witch.

  

A real one, in case you were wondering.

_Five of Cups._  
  

Class: Witch (True)
===================

> Witches are dark creatures born to followers of the Old Ways who have consorted with spirits, monsters, or beasts. More monster than man, they are an object of both fear and awe. Witches across the old world are regularly abandoned or exiled, so naturally many of them find their way to the Mountain.

There are at least four kinds of witch—categorized by the form which their **familiar** takes—but all share certain traits and abilities. Most important among these is the ability to perceive, communicate with, and command **demons** through the use of **Maleficent Dice,** a process that functions exactly identical to that for casting **spells** with **Magic Dice.** If you're playing in a system with **proficiency,** you have it in staves, knives, scythes, and sickles. If you're a **gun witch,** you're also **proficient** with all types of **firearm.**

**Skills:** **1\.** Herbalism **2.** Divining **3.** Theatrics

**Starting Equipment:** Peasant clothing, a **satchel**, a skin of **water**, a skin of **wine**, a flint **fire-striker**, 10 **candles**, 3 rations of **jerky**, your choice of a golden **sickle** or jeweled **kris** (each a **light** weapon), one **witching tool** from the list at the end. 

If you're a **gun witch**, you also start with 10 witch-bullets and a powderhorn containing 10 doses of witch-powder. They're actually normal bullets and powder, but you're a witch. 1 slot each.

**A** Flawed, Familiar, Black Magic, 1 MD  
**B** Trophy Casting, +1 MD  
**C** Improved Familiar, +1 MD  
**D** Witch's Curse, +1 MD

**A: Flawed   
**While directly exposed to the object of your **supernatural weakness**, you experience extreme pain and revulsion and suffer **\-2 to all rolls** or **1 damage per round** as your form visibly rots, burns, or melts away (whichever effects your **GM** feels are appropriate). You can take measures to protect yourself; for example a weakness to sunlight can be minimized with voluminous clothing and a parasol.

Good weaknesses include but are not limited to: 

1.  Sunlight and depictions of the sun
2.  Precious metals
3.  Ferrous metals
4.  Melodies
5.  Your own reflection
6.  Expressions of strong emotion
7.  Dogs, horses, and whales
8.  Running water
9.  Oil
10.  Prepared food and cut stone

**A: Familiar**  
As a witch, you have the ability to **separate and externalize a piece of yourself** in the form of a familiar. This takes **10 minutes of concentration** and **1d6 HP** each time you do it. If destroyed or separated from you, your familiars melt into a mess of blood and keratin over the next **4 days**.

What form your familiar takes determines what sort of witch you are, or perhaps the other way around. You have four options:

1.  **Gun Witch**  
    As a gun witch, your familiars are **witch-guns**, up to **\[templates\] \* 2 firearms**. They can be created as any firearm weapon, but require ammunition and powder as normal; deal **1d8** damage regardless of form; and will not fire when wielded by anyone other than you. You are fluent in a dialect of **[Artifice](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html)** spoken only by firearms.  
      
    At template **C**when you gain **Improved Familiar**, your witch-guns deal **2d8** damage and gain the ability to move and manipulate themselves while remaining within your arms' reach. Gun witches who have attained this power are surrounded in combat by a whirling maelstrom of guns and ammo, plucking them from the air in a dance of death before releasing them, empty, to be reloaded by the cross-currents; while stylish, this is a horrifically inefficient way of reloading a firearm and takes **twice as long** as normal.  
      
    
2.  **Bug Witch  
    **As a bug witch, your familiars are **witch-hives**, up to **\[templates\] \* 2 swarms of vermin **that move at your command. They can be whatever type or types of bug you want, and you can fit them all inside yourself and/or your clothes if you want, which is just horrid. You are fluent in **[Skittering](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html)**, a language common to all arthropods.  
      
    **BUGWITCH SWARM STATS (EACH)  
    HD** 1**HP** 4 **Size** 5' square **Immune** non-area-of-effect damage  
    **Special** Deals **1d6** damage per round to everything other than you within its area that is vulnerable to being eaten by bugs (most things), without an **attack roll** or **save** or any of that nonsense. This doesn't stack because, uh, there's only enough room for so many bugs to eat something at once.  
      
    At template **C** when you gain **Improved Familiar**, your witch-hives are imbued with preternatural strength, allowing them to carry you (or anything else, though they'll still be eating it while they do so) up any surface that a bug could climb; or buoy you slowly aloft on thousands of diaphanous wings at a rate of **10'** per round. They can only do this for a few minutes at most—you can't fly overland on bugwings. Unwilling bugluggage may make a **STR** save to avoid being bugnapped.  
      
    
3.  **Friend Witch**  
    As a friend witch, your familiar is a **witch-tulpa**, also known as a **friend**. Unlike most familiars, this isn't so much a piece of your soul externalized into a physical form as it is merely separated from the rest of your selfhood and sequestered within. While carrying a **friend**, you gain their **visible traits**, **restriction**, and **first boon**.  
      
    **Having friends is a bit complicated, so there's a section downbelow (under the spells and mishaps and dooms and such) that details how that works.**  
      
    At template **C**when you gain **Improved Familiar**, you achieve complete (dis)unity with your **friends**, gaining the **second boon** of any **friend** that you carry as well.  
      
    
4.  **Cancer Witch**  
    As a cancer witch, your familiar is a **witch-tumor** which (ha, a-ha) quarantines within itself and protects you from the effects of any [**diseases or other maladies**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/plagues-and-poxes.html) that you contract. You may choose to pass or fail **saves** against such maladies when you encounter them, and are able to secrete **diseased blood** from your palms which causes any who contact it to **save** against transmission of any maladies thus contained.  
      
    If you are ever subject to an effect that **cures diseases**, your witch-tumor dies along with any maladies contained within it and you must create a new one.  
      
    At template **C**when you gain **Improved Familiar**, you gain the ability to spray a torrent of **diseased blood** from your palms like a really gross firehose. This costs you **1 HP** each time you do it, and reaches, I don't know, at least **30'** straight up or up to **60'** in a horizontal arc.

**A: Black Magic**  
You are familiar with two **spells** from the list way downbelow. One is the **demon** known as _Evil Eye_, and the other is determined by rolling **1d20**. Each time you gain another template of Witch, roll once to attract a new **spell**—if you roll a result you already possess, choose the next **spell** above or below it that you don't already have.  
  
**B: Trophy Casting**  
You have developed methods of enhancing your power and protecting yourself from the hazards of spellcasting, using your blood and **trophies** with significance to the **Old Ways** as fuel. You can voluntarily change any number of **MD** to show a **6** after rolling them, allowing you to avoid chaos or doom, at the cost of consuming a **trophy** and taking **damage equal to the original die result** for each **MD** to be changed.  
  
Examples of **trophies** include: **snake skeletons**, **wolf hearts**, **shark jawbones**, and **jars of ash from the corpses of sentient creatures that burned to death**. Only one **trophy** may be produced from each corpse, and a corpse must be at least of small size to produce a **trophy**. A **trophy** takes up **1/3** of an inventory slot.  
  
**D: Witch's Curse**

When a powerful witch such as yourself pronounces a **curse**, the universe takes notice. In order for this to work properly you must have been legitimately (in your eyes, and those of the **DM**) wronged by your victim-to-be, otherwise you can just curse them with _Evil Eye_ like a lesser witch.  
  
In addition, tales of your exploits and magical potency have by now reached the Civilized Lands and caused folk there to Take Notice. Expect an **apprentice warlock** and **1d6** **furious witch-hunters** to arrive on the next ship—if they aren't here already.

Witch Magic
===========

As a **spellcaster**, you are able to perceive and communicate with the spirits known commonly as **spells**. As a **witch**, those available to _you_ to command (by means of your **MD**) are technically termed **[demons](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/12/de-luminare-minus-caelestis-hierarchia.html)**, also known as **elementals**, though this system of classification is somewhat tautological. Alas.

  

Other **spells** may exist, and you may be able to bribe, coerce, or otherwise convince them to join you. By the same token, experienced witches and such met in the wild may travel with **spells** outside this list.

1.  **Evil Eye**  
    _A hunched form with a single large eye and pointed ears; or are they horns? Their material appearance varies significantly between instances__—plant matter, stone, raw flesh..._  
    The first **demon** any witch becomes familiar (ha, aha) with. He may be ordered to harass a target, tweaking their ears and tying their shoelaces together and generally being a nuisance until given a new order. If it matters, he can exert up to **\[sum\]** pounds of force at a time during this duration. Owing to his simple-minded and generally servile nature, he is easy to bribe or goad (using **MD**) into performing tasks outside his usual repertoire—_nearly _all of which he is wildly incompetent at.  
      
    
2.  **Hand**  
    _She is a mass of red ribbons, stretched across every available space. She 'speaks' seldom, and softly when she does._  
    While you concentrate, _Hand_ can lift and move objects within a stone's throw gently at a rate of **\[dice\] \* 30'** per round, or hurl them up to **\[dice\] \* 60'** dealing **\[sum\]** damage to them and anything they impact with a **DEX** roll for half. If used to crush, tear, etc, she deals **\[sum\] **damage per round. She cannot affect targets that pass a **CHA** save (or have one passed by their holder/wielder/wearer/etc), and is limited to targets of approximate mass relative to the number of **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD** - a handheld object or small animal
*   **2 MD** - a person plus gear
*   **3 MD** - a horse or monitor plus rider and saddlebags
*   **4 MD** - a fully laden wagon
*   **5 MD** - a small house plus inhabitants and furniture  
      
    

4.  **Mend**  
    _He is grey-skinned and sullen, wearing something that looks like tradesman's leathers. Can be roused to enthusiasm by detailed engineering discussions.  
    Mend_ patches holes, welds breaks, and otherwise repairs the touched object instantly, healing up to **\[sum\] + \[dice\]** HP to it if it has HP or fixing any amount of damage short of complete destruction if it does not. If an object _has_ been completely destroyed, _Mend_ may still be able to reconstitute it depending on its complexity and the number of **MD** invested in him:

*   **1** MD** - simple shapes, blocks of material**
*   **2 MD** - boats, wagons, bridges, most weapons and armor
*   **3 MD** - artworks, siege engines, sailing vessels, complex architecture
*   **4 MD** - clockworks, repeating firearms, steam engines
*   **5 MD** - most corpses (though _Mend_ cannot restore life), most electrical devices  
      
    

6.  **Shatter**  
    _She is boldly colored and somewhat crudely formed, as if pieced together from scrap clay by an inexpert sculptor. Over-fond of complex plans and mechanisms. Thinks she's smarter than she is._  
    In order to command _Shatter,_ her name must be shouted; not merely spoken. She does exactly what her name suggests to any target within shouting distance, and is capable of wreaking an amount of destruction relative to the **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD** - A few blows with a hammer (A handheld object, an artwork)
*   **2 MD** - Two folks with tools (A door, a chest, a sarcophagus)
*   **3 MD** - A half-dozen tradesfolk with block and tackle (A tunnel, a wooden building, an architectural feature)
*   **4 MD** - A dozen tradesfolk with heavy equipment (A stone building or fortification, a large cavern)  
      
    

8.  **Enlarge**  
    _She is blue-skinned, elephant-headed, enormous. Refuses to believe problems can be solved by any means other than physical force.  
    Enlarge_ doubles the size of the touched target **\[dice\]** times for up to **\[sum\]** minutes. If the target is a creature, it gets **+2 STR** and **\-2 DEX** for each time it is doubled, and anything worn or carried by it likewise increases in size. For each time size is doubled, weight quadruples.  
      
    
9.  **Reduce**  
    _He is red-skinned, bull-headed, _enormous_._ Refuses to believe problems can be solved by any means other than physical force.  
    _Reduce halves the size of the touched target **\[dice\]** times for up to **\[sum\]** minutes. If the target is a creature, it gets **\-2 STR** and **+2 DEX** for each time it is halved, and anything worn or carried by it likewise decreases in size. For each time size is halved, weight is quartered.  
      
    _
10.  **Heal**  
    _Wears a linen robe, clinical, detached, omits names and pronouns when speaking. __Seen it all before, twice._  
    Heals the touched target for **\[sum\] + \[dice\]** HP. Alternatively, can be directed to solve specific problems depending on the **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD -** No alternatives.
*   **2 MD** - Mend broken bones or other long-term wounds.
*   **3 MD** - Cure a malady such as disease or poison.
*   **4 MD** - Reattach recently severed limbs.
*   **5 MD** - Regrow missing limbs or organs.  
      
    

12.  **Inflict**  
    _He is a crying youth with six many-jointed arms. Two cover his face, two hug his body, and two wield straight razors in furious slashing arcs._  
    _Inflict_ cuts a given target within a stone's throw for **\[sum\] + \[dice\]** damage. He refuses to be directed against inanimate objects specifically, or ones which don't appear to bleed or feel pain.  
      
    
13.  **Illusion**  
    _He is long-haired and vain and aristocratic, pouts if formed into something ugly and preens if formed into something beautiful. His aesthetic sensibilities are focused on bright, clashing colors._  
    _Illusion_ shapes himself into an object or creature up to **\[dice\] \* 5'** in diameter, which appears completely real and moves however you desire but produces no sound, smell, touch, heat, etc. Shaping _Illusion_ into a detailed copy of an existing object or creature requires either close familiarity or a reference to work from. Creatures inspecting _Illusion_ closely may roll **INT** to determine his true nature.  
      
    
14.  **Darkness**  
    _He is a three-meter-long grub, black and shiny and dimly transparent. Clumsy, sleeps more than he's awake.  
    Darkness_ attaches himself to the touched target and radiates a cloud of absolute magical darkness in a **\[dice\] \* 10'** radius. Non-magical sight within or through the radius is completely impossible. He can maintain this effect for up to **\[sum\]** hours when attached to an inanimate, unattended, or willing target, or **\[sum\]** rounds if attached to an unwilling one that succeeds a **CHA** save.  
      
    
15.  **Invisibility**  
    _She is faceless, wearing a dark business suit. She chatters with the neurotic, anxious edge of an inferiority complex, especially when performing a task._  
    _Invisibility_ submerges the target partway into the ethereal plane for up to **\[dice\] \* \[sum\]** minutes, rendering them completely invisible to normal sight and able to see other invisible creatures and objects. If cast with **4 MD**, she hides the target from supernatural vision of non-invisible creatures as well.  
      
    
16.  **Scrying**  
    _It has a boxy, geometrically shaped head and a large, hooded eye. Below the neck, it disappears into a mess of black-feathered wings and a single, large crow's foot.  
    Scrying_ will allow you to perceive through its eye at will, and can be directed to seek out any target that you know the name of and could identify in a lineup of similar targets regardless of line-of-sight or range, which it will watch for up to **\[dice\]** \* **\[sum\]** hours.If it matters, it flies about as fast as a commercial airliner. For each **MD** invested in it beyond the first, you may have it perform one additional task from this list:

*   Relay sound to you.
*   Relay touch, taste, and smell to you.
*   Allow you to speak through it.
*   Alert you under specific conditions even if you're not paying attention (or sleeping).  
      
    

18.  **Open**  
    _He wears a jumpsuit or coverall, and has four many-jointed arms tipped with jagged steel spines. He is a creep, a voyeur, a kleptomaniac, and argues vociferously for you to fulfill his desires.  
    Opens_ a target within a stone's throw. [Doors are flung wide, shackles bent open, belts come undone.](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-orthodox-wizards.html) The occupants of armor, clothing, mecha, etc. are expelled. If the target is secured, attended, or sapient, _Open_ is **\[dice\] level** with **+\[best\] STR**, and **skilled** at opening things.   
      
    
19.  **Hold**  
    _She is a sinister figure in white, blindfolded, bound in chains and one of those funny jackets that won't let you check your wristwatch. She speaks in a piercing, imperious voice._  
    Closes and locks (if applicable; doors slam shut, drawbridges slam up, half-drawn swords slam back in their scabbards) a target within a stone's throw, then _Holds_ it in place for up to **\[sum\]** rounds. If the target is secured, attended, or sapient, _Hold_ is **\[dice\] level** with **+\[best\] STR**, and **skilled** at wrestling.  
      
    
20.  **[Terror](https://scryfall.com/card/brb/87/terror)**  
    _He is an emaciated figure, contorted into a fetal position with wild eyes and every muscle tensed. He is terrified of everything, for absolutely __blisteringly incoherent and conspiratorial reasons. If asked to elaborate on a given phobia, he has a_ **1-in-6**_ chance of being (in some small part) correct in his fears._  
    Emanates a burst of psychic _Terror_, causing up to **\[sum\]** targets of **\[dice\] HD** or less to roll **CHA** or flee your presence for **\[sum\]** rounds. If unable to flee, targets that fail their saves cower unresponsively for the duration. Targets that succeed their saves or remain in your presence beyond his duration are **shaken**, and suffer a **\-2** penalty to everything until they are able to escape you and take a minute to calm down.  
      
    
21.  **Sleep**  
    _He is a twitching, aberrant wreck, paranoid shivers and sharp edges cast in polished steel and white glass. He abhors violence and_ will _wake his targets by shrieking if you plot to execute them._  
    Causes up to **\[sum\]** targets of **\[dice\] HD** or less to roll **CHA** or fall into a deep, coma-like sleep for **\[sum\]** hours, from which they can only be awoken by vigorous slapping/shaking (which takes an action from someone nearby) or damage, and during which they do not require any food or water. Surprised targets automatically fail their saves, and if cast on a single target with more than one **MD** his effects are permanent until awakened.  
      
    
22.  **Fog**  
    _He is a pile of cyan-stained rags and linens that only vaguely resembles a humanoid form. A diffuse, pale glow emanates from where his face would be._  
    A huge quantity of black _Fog_ pours forth from your mouth and nose, spreading to cover a **\[dice\] \* 30'** radius for up to **\[sum\]** hours, or **\[dice\]** minutes in bright sunlight or strong wind. The density and effects of the fog vary with the number of **MD** invested in him:

*   **1 MD** - The fog is sufficient to obscure details (faces, etc) and apply **disadvantage** to ranged attacks made through it.  
    
*   **2 MD** - The fog is sufficient to obscure objects more than **5'** away in their entirety.  
    
*   **3 MD** - The fogis thick enough to conceal an outstretched hand, and completely opaque to supernatural vision.  
    
*   **4 MD** - The fogdeals **\[best\]** damage to creatures other than you with every breath, and they must roll **STR** each round or be struck permanently blind if it contacts their eyes directly. When commanded with this number of **MD**, _Fog_ instead answers to the name _Cloudkill_.  
      
    

24.  **Animate Dead**  
    _She is an old woman, black-shrouded and mourning. Her voice carries the weight of centuries, and she teases at ancient secrets.  
    Animates_ a touched corpse of **\[dice\] \* 2 ****HD** or fewer, raising it as undead. If cast with **2 or less MD** the undead raised are unintelligent and will serve you unquestioningly. If cast with **3 or more MD** the undead raised are intelligent, created free, and may roll **CHA** to resist being brought back into the world if they desire. The specific type of undead raised depends on the number of **MD** invested in her, and the ritual preparations undergone as a part of the casting:

*   **1 MD** - _Skeleton_. Requires black gemstones worth at least **25 sp**, which are placed in the eye sockets of the corpse. Removing the flesh of a corpse that is not already skeletonized takes at least one hour of solid work.
*   **2 MD** - _Zombie_. Requires embalming and preservative agents worth at least **50 sp** and one hour to properly apply them, or a corpse which has already been preserved through similar methods. Alternately, zombies can be created with no preparation or materials from a fresh corpse, but will be paralyzed by rigor mortis within **\[sum\]** hours.
*   **3 MD** - _Ghoul._ Requires a piece of dead flesh and gnawed bone both from the corpse of a sapient creature, a pot of grave earth, a fragment of crypt or tombstone, and ten minutes to force all of the above down the target's throat and into its stomach.  
    
*   **4 MD** - _Revenant._ Requires black gemstones worth at least **1,000 sp**, the bottled soul of a sapient creature, and one minute to lure the target's soul back to their body using the above as sacrifices.
*   **5 MD** - _Haunting_. Requires an item of the target's that had great personal value to them when they were alive, and six hours to carry out the necessary rituals to summon and re-bind them to their corpse.
*   **6 MD** \- _Lich._ Requires uniquely powerful reagents that are _definitely_ not for sale, and twenty four hours to conduct an elaborate ritual extracting and processing the target's soul. _Animate Dead_ resents answering to this name, and protests its inaccuracy.  
      
    

26.  **Abjure**  
    _He is a small child formed from blue-tinged iron, nervous and fretting with bracelets. He is lonely, friendly, and craves the company of other demons.  
    Abjures_ magical effects, elementals, devils, other **spells**, the animating spirits of undead or constructs, curses, &c back to wherever they came from. He reduces his target's **\[dice\]** and **\[sum\]** each by his own, completely banishing them if either is reduced to **0**; use **HP** and **HD** in their place if it's a target that doesn't have those values. If commanded as a **readied action**, _Abjure_ can affect others **spells** as they're cast and before they take effect.   
      
    
27.  **Summon**  
    _She is a devilress clad in black businesswear, her proportions slightly off when viewed from the corner of your eye. Her fingers taper to red-stained razor points, and her ever-so-slightly-too-wide grin hides a forest of needlelike teeth. She is quick to inform about the dangers of commanding her, and has release forms and waivers to be signed if you do.  
    Summons_ a devil of **\[dice\] HD** and **\[sum\] HP** for **\[sum\]** rounds. The devil is not in any way compelled to do your bidding unless you know its **true name**, in which case it is unable to harm you and you may dismiss it at will. Commanding _Summon_ with more preparation (and signing more of her contracts and forms) allows a longer duration and more control over the devil to be summoned:  
    

*   With one round of preparation (a hasty signature, a quick sigil on the ground) the summoning persists for **\[sum\]** minutes and you may make one opposed **CHA** roll to banish the devil per round (for example, if it's trying to kill you).
*   With one hour of preparation (a lengthy perusal of contracts, a well-formed summoning circle) the summoning persists for **\[sum\]** hours and the devil is unable to leave the summoning circle until you allow it (traditionally, after it's agreed not to kill you).

Witching Mishaps
----------------

1.  You contract **[Snoos](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/plagues-and-poxes.html)**, a sort of exposure-induced allergy to magical irradiation which causes any further magical effects to **stun** you into a watery-eyed sneezing fit for **1 round** each. In addition, your skin gives off a faint blue glow until next dawn.
2.  Your veins turn [jet black](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-let-there-be-blood-and-also.html) beneath your skin, stiff and painful. You gain no benefit (aside from your blood returning to normal) the next time you **rest**, and take **1 damage** per minute exposed to **sunlight **until you do.
3.  Shards of black glass explode into being around you, pelting everything within **20'** (including you) for **\[sum\]** damage, **DEX** half. Until the next dawn, any wounds you directly inflict on others are mirrored onto your own flesh.
4.  A torrent of winged insects issues from your mouth for **\[dice\]** rounds, preventing you from doing anything other than stagger around. Anyone within **20'** must roll **CHA** or be likewise incapacitated as they flail and swat at the choking swarm.
5.  Your mouth seals itself into a smooth expanse, preventing you from speaking or casting spells for **\[sum\]** minutes. Stubby mushrooms sprout from all inanimate surfaces in a **\[dice\] \* 5'** radius ring.
6.  Up to **\[sum\]** nearby corpses rise from the grave and attack you with single-minded intensity, moaning and whispering your name. Plants within a **\[dice\] \* 5' **radius wither away and will never grow there again.

Witching Dooms
--------------

Witch (ha, aha) **doom** do you get? I guess it depends.  
  

### Doom of Fish

1.  Your eyes grow huge and milky, your flesh grey and slick. You can see in the dark.  
    
2.  Your skin hardens to glimmering scales, webs grow between your extremities and your body. **+4 AC**; double speed in the water, half speed on land.  
    
3.  Your lungs reshape and extrude themselves onto the surface of your skin as gills, and your limbs wither away into sleek-spined fins. You're a fish now, can't speak any language other than **Hadeal**, and drown in open air.  
    

The Doom of Fish can be escaped by capturing the teeth of a **sea monster** and burying them in dry land.  
  

### Doom of Blood

1.  Blood crusts slowly around your eyes, nostrils, other orifices. You heal **1 HP** per pint of blood you drink.
2.  Your wounds no longer close, and blood beads slowly through your skin. You no longer heal naturally from food or rest.
3.  Your skin sloughs off entirely, and a torrent of blood issues perpetually from any uncovered openings in your body. You can't speak any language other than **Serumic**, and lose **1 HP** per hour.  
    

The Doom of Blood can be escaped by **removing** all of your blood—which becomes progressively more difficult as you advance in this Doom, since it gives you more blood or you'd bleed out even faster than it already makes you.  
  

### Doom of Ashes

1.  Your flesh turns black; your [blood thick, syrupy, and magnetic](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-let-there-be-blood-and-also.html). No wound can kill you, though you still risk death—and dismemberment—by other means.
2.  Your entire body aches, and your eyes are as black as void. Absolute darkness is daylight to you, but even dim light blinds. Any spells you cast that would create light—even incidental—create magical darkness instead.
3.  You fade into a charred and insubstantial shadow, rendering you unable to interact with physical objects or speak any language other than **Ember**. Bright illumination destroys any part of you that it touches.

The Doom of Ashes can be escaped by giving up an **archdemon** as a burnt offering, in a ritual presided over by a priest of appropriate power.  
  

### Doom of Bones

1.  Bones rattle angrily about and against each other in your presence, causing you and anything adjacent to you that possesses bones to suffer **disadvantage** on any tasks requiring dexterity or quiet.
2.  Corpses which possess skeletons **animate** in your presence and attack you, and even loose bones gain some level of locomotion and will do their best to harm you.
3.  Your own bones rebel against you, escaping your flesh as an animate **skeleton** and rendering you unable to speak or understand **Clatter** if you could before, or—perhaps more importantly—move in anything approaching a useful fashion. On the upside, I guess you don't personally suffer from your first Doom anymore.  
    

The Doom of Bones can be escaped by replacing your (traitorous, scheming) skeleton with bones cut from a suitably impressive **snake**. Some crushing and [sintering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering) may be necessary.

Witch-Tulpas (also known as Friends)
====================================

Summoning a **friend** works the same way as it does with other familiars (**10 minutes**, **1d6 HP**, et al) but once summoned they are carried within your soul, rather than physically. If you break a breakable **restriction** of the **friend** you are carrying, you immediately stop carrying that **friend **and take **1d6** damage due to psychic shock.

  

Each time you gain a template of friend witch—including the first—**roll once** on the list below to determine which **friend** you are able to summon. If you eat the heart of another friend witch, you gain the ability to summon any **friend** they were carrying at the time of their death.
