Specifically I wrote this in like 2018 and just did the last 10% right now and have been persuaded—against my better judgement and thanks to the nefarious denizens of the OSR discord—to start a blog and it seemed like a good first post.  
  
You can get it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/110BKZlxkJQIFUqZoIQen_y9VTIR4jG2q/view) on Google Drive.  
  
I have run exactly one abortive play-testing campaign using this game and it was fun as hell.  
  
**EDIT:** If you've come here looking for fun things to steal, it has:  

*   Communism!
*   A two-axis alignment system with mechanical effects!
*   Classes that auto-succeed at things as their only ability!
*   Vehicle rules!
*   A simple system for managing aerial dogfighting!
*   A system to create stats for pre-jet aircraft with just the input available from wikipedia!
