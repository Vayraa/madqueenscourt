The inimitable Luther Gutekunst of [Archon's Court](https://archons-court.blogspot.com/) posted a [200-word RPG](https://archons-court.blogspot.com/2020/08/canyon-200-word-rpg.html) today. Here's his description:  

> _[Canyon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mehUbmM1tSiGKDNwBwBl6tIZY9lCfvIc/view) is a duet game about resource management and unexpected solutions, set in a largely undescribed post-apocalypse. I haven't gotten to test it yet, but I'd like to._

It's _really_ good. I played a test run. It wasn't supposed to be a solo RPG, but the way the ghoul acts seemed so perfect for scripting that I couldn't help but think of it as one.

A handful of discord messages, a hastily googled public domain stock photo, and an hour and a half in photoshop later, I turned it into a one-page solo game:

Like all solo RPGs, this one probably requires a little bit of interpretation on the part of the player/GM - but not much. 

  

In case it helps, here are two playtest reports with very slight differences in interpretation. Both are correct:
