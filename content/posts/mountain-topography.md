Bit of a cop-out, but I've gotta catch up to [GLOGtober](https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html) and I have a map of the [Mountain](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html) that I haven't posted yet.  
  
It's not this one, the side-view point map hastily scribbled on a piece of paper:

_clicc for big, but I've already posted this one._

It **is** this one, a topographical map:

_clicc for big, this one is new._

This was created for me ages ago by [kahva](https://madcartographer.com/) and I never did anything with it, but I really like it. I suppose it'll be especially useful if and when I need to do some overland travel bits in a game. I've added the [two cities](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-tale-of-two-citiesit-takes.html) myself with very little consideration - their positions aren't final.
