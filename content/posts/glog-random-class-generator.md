_For this story to make sense, I'll have to begin at the beginning._  
  
Actually, scratch that, it'll make less sense if I do. I'm going to do it anyway, of course. Bear with me here:

  

In the beginning, a bunch of people in Victorian Britain wrote terrible novels...

  

No, that's too early. Let me start over.  
  
In the beginning, which was about five years ago, [Joseph Manola posted a list of Victorian "penny dreadful" novel titles.](https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-heads-of-headless-penny-dreadful.html)

  

Yesterday, I think, [OSR discord user deus ex parabola](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/) took that list and transformed it into potential class names.

  

Over the course of that day, [OSR discord user deus ex parabola](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/), [Phlox](http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/07/parabolas-50-glog-classes-part-1.html), [Lynn](http://wordsforyellow.blogspot.com/), Gorinch, [Xeno](https://xenophonsramblings.blogspot.com/)[phon of Athens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon), Purplecthulu, [Oblidisideryptch](https://oblidisideryptch.blogspot.com/), and I turned them into (rough) class templates.

  

Then deus ex parabola [posted them on his blog.](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/07/i-wrote-list-of-fifty-class-names-and.html)

  

[...And then _I_ turned it into a random generator that mashes them all together.

_[It produces things like **this.**](http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=1Qv45r1A)_

  

It's surprisingly coherent sometimes. Maybe about a third of the time.  
  
I am not sorry for what I have done and I hope it brings anyone who reads this joy and pain in equal measure. Post your favorite things it's come up with!
