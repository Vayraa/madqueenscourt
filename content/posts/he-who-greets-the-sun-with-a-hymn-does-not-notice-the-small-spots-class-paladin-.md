The final "base class" for the Mountain, just in time**at least a week and a half too late** for me to run a game. These owe, obviously, a great debt to the [**masked clerics**](https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html) of **G\_d**.

_Three of Wands._

Class: Paladin
--------------

> _Every paladin has a Revelation; a vision which causes them to break with the dogma of the Church and leads them to the Mountain on a divine mission. Every paladin is a prophet, an apostate, and a heretic, blessed with divine self-righteousness and strength of faith; it is they who have heard the word of G\_d, they who speak holy truth, and they who decide what is divine necessity and what is false ceremony._

There's a big Church back in the Civilized Lands, with complex theology and dogma and all of that nonsense. You're not connected to it and don't have to worry about any of that. You may end up with one or two strictures by virtue of your Revelation and Miracles, but that's it. The things you do are holy by definition; feel free to associate with [**witches**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/07/something-wicked-this-way-comes-class.html) and [**thiefs**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html) and by your presence they shall be redeemed. 

Every template of Paladin you have gives you **+1 to resisting coercion and withstanding hardship.** Your second and fourth templates also each give you **+1 to-hit.** My system doesn't actually have **proficiency** so I don't know why I keep listing them off like it does and I'm not going to anymore.

**Skills:** **1.** Farming **2.** Rhetoric** 3.** Prophecy

**Starting Equipment:** A **holy symbol**, a **short stave**, **practical clothing** and a **rucksack**, a **wool blanket**, **waterskin**, 3** torches**, 3 **iron rations**, 50' of stout hempen **rope**, a **book of hymns and folk songs**, and one **relic** from the list at the end.

**A** Orisons, First Revelation  
**B** Miracles, +1 MD  
**C** Fury, Second Revelation  
**D** Coronation, +1 MD

**A: Orisons**  
At will, you may do any of the following:  

*   Conjure a torch-sized flame into your cupped palm.
*   Consecrate a man-made flame of bonfire size or smaller, causing it to produce no ash nor smoke.
*   Refuse to be burned by any fire of not-specifically-malicious intent.
*   Know the position of the sun, the approximate time and exact date, and which cardinal direction you are facing.

**A: Revelation**  
As a paladin, you have received a revelation; a prophetic vision with more weight and detail to it than the nightmarish dreams suffered by most who are called to the Mountain, shewing them a potential End of the World as well as a means by which it may be averted. Each paladin's revelation is unique, but four broad themes seem to be present:

1.  **Revelation of the Hearth (Choirs)  
    **_Throngs of the faithful gather around great bonfires to repel the assault of infernal forces, vast armies of black glass and iridescent chitin. We're strongest together; our bonds are our might.  
    _Those who have received the revelation of the hearth know that there is nothing greater than what people can achieve in companionship. Their most important duty is to find allies against the darkness.  
      
    Hearth paladins shave and tattoo their heads and bodies, and are sometimes called Choirs. Their **primary restriction** is that they may not cause harm to one who has not acted violently in their presence, and their **secondary restriction** is that they must not consume the flesh nor eggs of anything with or without a face.  
      
    

1.  **Castigation**  
    Upon receiving your **first revelation**, your voice cannot be **ignored**, **muffled**, or **muted**. When you spend an action to deliver curses and invective with appropriate gravity, your target must check **morale**. If they **succeed**, they must primarily target you for the remainder of the encounter—**failure** means they break, flee, etc as normal.  
      
    
2.  **[God](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/06/god-throat-paladins.html) [Throat](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/11/osr-class-paladin-of-word.html)  
    **Upon receiving your **second revelation** you gain the service of the **angel** known as _WORD, _so styled because she answers to many names. Her dossier can be found at the end of the list of **angels** far below.  
      
    

3.  **Revelation of Gunpowder (Judges)**  
    _Steel-eyed inquisitors plumb the depths of the world, unearthing great fiends in their lairs and striking them down. Victory can be won only __by discovering and destroying the greatest evils before they can destroy us._  
    Those who have received the revelation of gunpowder know that they are soldiers in an unending war. Their most important duty is to slay the enemies of righteousness before they are able to act.  
      
    Gunpowder paladins weave wooden tokens into their hair, wear muted colors, wield hammers and pistols, and are sometimes called Judges or Inquisitors. Their **primary restriction** is that they must not turn their back on an opportunity to destroy or prevent evil, and their **secondary restriction** is that they may not carry nor wield bladed instruments.  
      
    

1.  **Bloodhound  
    **Upon receiving your **first revelation** your senses are finely attuned to signs beyond the purely physical, allowing you to **smell** the distinctive reek of **secrecy**. This won't tell you anything _about_ secrets except their existence, but is of great help in discovering traps, secret doors and compartments, people who are trying to hide, et cetera.  
      
    
2.  **Veritas Dei**  
    Upon receiving your **second revelation** your very soul revolts against falsehood, causing you **1** damage for each consciously spoken untruth you utter and allowing you to **see lies** and instinctively judge the **weight of souls**.  
      
    

5.  **Revelation of the Torch (Contemplatives)**  
    _A lone hero scales an infinite incline, torch held high, tested mentally, physically, and in spirit. The only one who can be counted on, in the end, is oneself; so each must individually become the best, strongest self possible if we are to survive as a whole._  
    Those who have received the revelation of the torch know that relentless self-improvement is the highest virtue. Their most important duty is to better themselves in every fashion—become stronger, healthier, more virtuous, better educated_—_and to help others do the same.  
      
    Torch paladins oil their bodies and bare their hands and feet, and are sometimes called Apotheosites, Templar, and Contemplatives. Their **primary restriction** is that they must test themselves against the strong and vice versa, and their **secondary restriction** is that they may not tell to others what they have not witnessed themselves.  
      
    

1.  **Sacred Martial Arts**  
    Upon receiving your **first revelation** your fists, knees, elbows, forehead, and any other part of your body you could conceivably strike someone with are are **light** weapons, and you are a **skilled wrestler**. When you hit someone with a melee attack, you can attempt a free **combat maneuver** against them if you name and describe your action as a **special move** (or use one previously named and described that makes sense in context). You can't use the same **special move** twice in the same combat.  
      
    
2.  **Force Projection  
    **Upon receiving your **second revelation** you master techniques of hand-to-hand combat far beyond the normal limits of human achievement. Your unarmed melee attacks have a **30'** reach and you can run on walls, spikes, or water as long as you end your turn on solid footing. Additional **secret techniques** may become available to you in your travels.  
      
    

7.  **Revelation of the Mirror (Scriveners)**  
    _Scholars delve deep in libraries and laboratories, their frenetic study essential despite the calamity outside, until finally, finally, the Secret which justifies any consequence is uncovered, the Work complete. Something terrible is Coming, and we'd be foolish indeed to discard any weapon which might be raised against it._  
    Those who have received the revelation of the mirror know that all the evils of the world pale in comparison to the great enemy that comes against it, and that the right or wrong of a sword or rifle lie in the hands that wield it. Their most important duty is to seek out power and knowledge that is lost, disdained, forgotten or forbidden.  
      
    Mirrored paladins cover their faces—with blank-featured or silvered masks when possible, or simple cloth when not—and are sometimes called Lenses, Silverfish, Warminds, and Scriveners. Their ****primary **restriction** is that they may not consciously allow knowledge to be lost, and their **secondary restriction** is that they must share knowledge with any who, in their estimation, should make use of it.  
      
    

1.  **Holy Seals**  
    Upon receiving your **first revelation**, each time you command an **angel** you may cause up to **\[templates\]** **blessed seals** in your possession to spontaneously combust: For each that does, you may **add** or **replace** one **MD**. You can produce new **seals** out of **10 sp** in wax, art supplies, and precious metals, at a rate of one per day as a part of your normal rest, and they each take up **1/3** of a slot.  
      
    You also gain the ability to perceive and communicate with the spirit world slightly earlier than your fellows, and the services of one **angel** rolled on the list from the end with **1d6** rather than **1d12**.  
      
    
2.  **Coronal Mass Ejection**  
    Upon receiving your **second revelation** you are able to resurrect a technique from the holy books long thought apocryphal: The ability to project an exploding laser beam directly out of your forehead at one billion miles per hour. Once per combat round, you may deal **1d6** holy fire damage to anything you can see.

Breaking your **secondary restriction** causes an immediate **mishap**. Breaking your **primary restriction** causes an immediate **doom**.

**B: Miracles**  
The world of **spirits** and **spells** reveals itself to you, and you gain the service of an **angel** (roll **1d12**) whom you are able to command through the use of **Miracle Dice** in exactly the same way someone else might cast a spell with **Magic Dice**. 

The saints of the Church are numerous, and each day of the year is the **feast day** of one or more, with collisions being the source of fierce dogmatic arguments. Your **MD** are replenished at **dawn** at a rate of **1 MD** per each of the following saintly attributes you are able to declare—up to your maximum **MD**—regardless of whether you **rested** or not:

*   Name and/or title
*   Portfolio
*   Saintly deeds
*   Method of martyrdom
*   Ritual observances  
    

For example you might declare, _"Today is the day of Giuseppe the Maligned, patron saint of psychiatry and comedy, who restored the grand mural of the Holy City, and was cast from a high cliff, and on whose day we must turn every handshake into an arm-wrestle,"_ and have declared all five attributes, and regain up to **5 MD** if you somehow have that many which should be impossible.

Upon gaining template **D**, you receive the services of a second **angel** of your choice.

**C: Fury**  
When engaged in **melee** combat, you may make one extra attack each round for free. The extra attack doesn't, technically, have to be a melee one.

**D: Coronation**  
You develop a **blessed halo**, the surest sign of your divine significance. This takes the form of either a diffuse radiance projected around your body or a hard-edged circlet of light hovering over your head. Regardless of its form, it **casts light as a torch** and protects you from harm, granting **+1 AC**. It is also _very_ impressive.

**Angels  
**
-------------

As a **spellcaster**, you are able to perceive and communicate with the spirits known commonly as **spells**. As a **paladin**, those available to _you_ to command (by means of your **MD**) are termed **angels**, the **handmaidens of G\_d**.

  

Other **spells** may exist, and you may be able to bribe, coerce, or otherwise convince them to join you. By the same token, experienced paladins and such met in the wild may travel with **spells** outside this list.

1.  **Missile**  
    _She is clad in a sleekly articulated plate harness, and wields a brace of darts which become visible when she casts them at a target. She is blunt in her manner and could be seen as arrogant, were her aim any less true.  
    _Throws **\[dice\]** darts, each of which unerringly strikes a target of your choice within sight for **4** damage. The darts of your Missile are formed from hard-edged white light and resemble...

1.  Dueling swords
2.  Arrows
3.  Spears
4.  Needles
5.  Birds of prey
6.  Longswords
7.  Throwing knives
8.  Circles or discs
9.  Shuriken
10.  Sidewinders  
      
    

3.  **Burning Hands**  
    _She is four-armed and muscular, bare from the waist up. Her fists are ever-clenched, each wreathed in flames too hot to fully consider.  
    _Heats the palms of your hands to a significant fraction of the temperature of the sun for **\[dice\]** minutes, while protecting you from the effects thereof. This is probably sufficient to melt through at least **\[sum\]** inches of stone or steel, set flammable objects on fire, fuse sand into brittle glass, and so on, and you may reroll all invested **MD** as damage dice when open-palm slapping someone with them. Alternatively, holding your hands up palm-outward is probably sufficient to ward away most potential threats without actual violence.  
      
    
4.  **Scorching Ray**  
    _Her bare head floats in the midst of a conflagration and heat haze, her body—if she has one—fully concealed. Her eyes burn a blank and angry red. She is colorblind.  
    _Projects up to **\[dice\]** rays of burning energy towards a target or targets of your choice within bowshot. Make a ranged attack roll against **AC 10** for each; any that hit deal **\[best\]** damage.  
      
    
5.  **Fireball**  
    _She is ineffably majestic, impossibly beautiful, a Queen among **angels** crowned by a third eye upon her brow and framed by nine wings behind her. She wears a fractally ornate gown and does not speak so much as command.  
    _Streaks to the designated area within bowshot and explodes, dealing **\[sum\] + \[dice\]** damage to everything within a **20'** radius with a **DEX** roll for half.  
      
    
6.  **Lightning**  
    _She is tense, almost nervous, filled with energy, a slightly sinister cast to her expressions. She is eager to create her effect, and has been known to__—under very specific circumstances__—disobey orders.  
    _Swoops through an area **10'** wide and **\[dice\]\*10'** long, dealing **\[sum\]**** + \[dice\]** damage to anyone and anything in her path with a **STR** roll for half.  
      
    
7.  **Supernova**  
    _She is serene, radiant, beatific in both bearing and conduct. She dresses for mourning, and her eyes are sad.  
    _Causes the targeted corpse to crumple inward and then explode in a flare of brilliant energy, dealing **\[sum\] \* 2** damage to everything within a **20'** radius with a **DEX **roll for half. If targeted on an undead that you do not personally control, they may roll **CHA** to avoid exploding. Requires a minimum investment of **MD** proportionate to the size of corpse she is to detonate:

*   **1 MD -** A hobgoblin, orc, or smaller 
*   **2 MD -** A bugbear, horse, minotaur, or smaller
*   **3 MD -** An elephant, ogre, or smaller
*   **4 MD -** A whale, giant, or smaller
*   **5 MD** - A dragon, kraken, or smaller  
      
    

9.  **Wall of Fire**  
    _She wears a general officer's uniform in an unfamiliar pattern, resplendent with medals and ribbons and braid. She has excellent tactical instincts, but a poor grasp of modern technology.  
    _Conjures up to **\[dice\]** **10' × 10' **×** 5'** sheets of searing flame, within a stone's throw, in whatever contiguous formation you desire and lasting for **\[sum\]** minutes. Any who enter or begin their turn within the area take **\[dice\]d6** damage, and catch fire for an additional **1d6** damage per round until extinguished. If placed over a creature, they may roll **DEX** in order to escape the area before the sheets manifest. If cast with **3 or more MD**, her conjured wall instead lasts for **\[sum\] **hours. If cast with **4 or more MD**, it is permanent.  
      
    
10.  **Radiate**  
    _She is slender and completely hairless, clad in a loose, gauzy shift. Her skeleton is starkly visible through her skin and garment. She perceives the world in wavelengths impossible to us, and does not understand the fragility of humans.  
    _Causes the targeted object within a stone's throw to radiate energy for up to **\[sum\]** hours, of a type dependent on how many **MD** were invested in her:

*   **1 MD -** Casts **bright** illumination out to **60'**, warms like a hearth.
*   **2 MD -** Casts **bright** illumination within sight range, counts as **sunlight**, warms like a pyre.
*   **3 MD -** Casts invisible rays of **blinding heat**, deals **\[dice\]** damage per round within **60'**, any who look at it within that range roll **STR** or are permanently blinded. Blocked by anything sufficiently opaque.
*   **4 MD -** Casts intangible rays of **poison fire**, deals **\[dice\] STR** damage per round within **30'** to all targets, including other **angels** and **spells**, et cetera. Only blocked by lead or stone.  
      
    

12.  **Glory**  
    _She is thick-wristed and -ankled, her face hidden behind a golden caricature mask with a giant, spiked halo affixed to its edges. She bears two massive golden swords which she wields in elaborate flourishes, and is fond of elaborate posing to punctuate her words.  
    _Increases your **STR** and **CHA** by **\[dice\]** each and grants you immunity to **poison**, **fear**, and other **maladies** for up to **\[sum\]** minutes. The additional **HP** you gain from increased **STR** are lost, in this case, before your "real" **HP**.  
      
    
13.  **Shield**  
    _She appears metal-fleshed, her limbs delicate armatures of piston and ball-joint beneath ornamented silver plating. She speaks only to narrate threat coefficients, with flat affect. Her appellative Shield is starkly utilitarian in contrast, a round-cornered rectangle of undecorated polished steel.   
    _Uses her _Shield_ to defend you or a target of your choice within arm's reach, granting **+\[dice\] AC** for up to **\[sum\]** hours against any attack she is aware of and completely negating _Missiles_ and _Rays_.  
      
    
14.  **Heal**  
    _Wears a linen robe, clinical, detached, omits names and pronouns when speaking. __Seen it all before, twice._  
    Heals the touched target for **\[sum\] + \[dice\]** HP. Alternatively, can be directed to solve specific problems depending on the **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD - **No alternatives.
*   **2 MD** - Mend broken bones or other long-term wounds.
*   **3 MD** - Cure a malady such as disease or poison.
*   **4 MD** - Reattach recently severed limbs.
*   **5 MD** - Regrow missing limbs or organs.  
      
    

16.  **Hold**  
    _She is a sinister figure in white, blindfolded, bound in chains and one of those funny jackets that won't let you check your wristwatch. She speaks in a piercing, imperious voice._  
    Closes and locks (if applicable; doors slam shut, drawbridges slam up, half-drawn swords slam back in their scabbards) a target within a stone's throw, then _Holds_ it in place for up to **\[sum\]** rounds. If the target is secured, attended, or sapient, _Hold_ is **\[dice\] level** with **+\[best\] STR**, and **skilled** at wrestling.  
      
    

*   [WORD](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWzv9e8V2zONLM6usvZe4_9uyoFwhpTQcZzLYyvZkag/edit#heading=h.d9mea1w854m2)  
    _She is dressed unassumingly in simple linen and scripture—the latter crawling over every inch of her skin. Her features are regal, more imposing than they are appealing._  
    Delivers a divine pronouncement of up to **\[dice\]** words, using her **WORD** as the main verb. Targets may not be specified except as a part of the pronouncement—speak carefully. Those with souls or personalities may roll **CHA** to avoid or reduce direct effects. If used to harm something with an **HP** value, she will usually deal **\[sum\]** damage as well as any incidental effects of the **WORD** used.  
      
    Roll two **WORDs** from the following list by which you may call your _WORD_:

1.  Blind
2.  Burn
3.  Boil  
    
4.  Desiccate
5.  Heat
6.  Illuminate  
    
7.  Imprison
8.  Melt
9.  Reveal
10.  Rise
11.  Sequester
12.  Ward

G\_dly Mishaps
--------------

1.  You attract a **crow or raven **which will forevermore follow and spy on you when you are under open sky. If trapped or killed, the corvid is replaced within **1d6** days.
2.  Your eyes turn smoky black, **blinding** you for **\[dice\]** rounds. They do not clear fully, leaving you with at least one permanent sunspot in your vision.
3.  Your wounds and scars open and **\[sum\]** fat, three-inch-long maggots plop sickeningly out at a rate of **one per round**. Each maggot that drops deals you **1 damage**. The maggots taste like motor oil, and anyone eating one heals **1 HP**.
4.  Your head is transformed into that of a dog for **\[sum\]** minutes, granting you the ability to speak and understand **[Arqot](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html)** but unable to converse in any other language for the duration.
5.  Dogs, horses, and other domesticated animals will see you as a **hated enemy** until the next dawn, and either attack you viciously or flee in terror depending on temperament.
6.  Your reflection fades by about **⅒** of its original opacity. This effect is permanent, and stacks—after **10** fadings, you no longer have a reflection. Further results cause a different reflection to fade back in at the same rate; one with no visible resemblance to you, and that doesn't match up to your movements. Once your reflection has faded **10** times out and **10** times back in, its negative is as real as its positive once was. **10** more and it's as real as you are yourself.  
      
    

Doom of the Sun
---------------

1.  You become able to hear the voice of the **Sun**. It is sonorous, commanding, quintuply resonant. The loudest voice speaks in an obtuse language which bears resemblances to both **angelfire** and the **old tongue**, and can be understood if you speak either of those languages. It is very distracting, causing a **\-2 penalty** to all **d20** rolls when exposed to natural sunlight, reduced to **\-1** if only partially exposed such as while indoors or under an overcast sky.
2.  **Sunlight** pours forth from your eyes and mouth whenever they are open, casting **bright** illumination in a **60'** cone. The penalty is no longer escapable, even with your eyes and mouth held shut.
3.  You emit **sunlight** from your entire body, casting **bright** illumination in an unlimited radius and **blinding** any who look directly at you. The voice of the **Sun** is now audible to others in your presence and inflicts the same penalty on them, and for you personally the penalty is **doubled** and sufficient to prevent you from commanding any **spells**.

The Doom of the Sun can be escaped by seeing the Sun destroyed, or by journeying to its surface and consuming a piece of whatever rules there.

Holy Relics
-----------

1.  **Holy Symbol.** An eight rayed sun-disk, traditionally copper but sometimes wood or gold. Yours is bigger than most, but it still doesn't take up any slots as long as you're wearing it.
2.  **Short Staff.** A sturdy inch-thick dowel of somewhat less than your height, making it a **medium** weapon while retaining some effectiveness as a walking stick. 1 slot.
3.  **Practical Clothing.** Sturdy wool and linen, unassuming, humble. 0 slots worn.
4.  **Wool Blanket.** Large enough to wrap oneself in fully, or double up and wear as a cloak. 1 slot.
5.  **Waterskin.** Essential. 1 slot when full.
6.  3 **Torches.** Simple sticks wrapped in hessian and soaked in pitch or wax. Burn for an hour each, cast **bright** light out to **30'** and **dim** light twice that distance. 1 slot total.
7.  3 **Iron Rations.** Thick cakes of preserved meat, parched grain, and chocolate. Won't go bad for _months_ as long as you keep them dry. 1 slot total.
8.  50' **Hempen Rope.** Coarse, thick, and unpleasant to the hand. 1 slot.
9.  **Book of Hymns and Folk Songs.** Lyrics and rough melodies; not detailed scores. Heavily annotated in at least three hands, before including yours. 1/3 slot.
10.  Bottle of **Holy Water.** Spiritually active, powerfully caustic to **devils** and some forms of **undead.** Drinking it cures **demon-**caused maladies. 1/3 slot.
11.  **Reactive Sledge.** A sacred tool of **gunpowder paladins.** A **heavy **weapon which explodes when struck hard against something to deal an additional **2d6** damage in a **5' **radius (including to the wielder), **DEX **half. 2 slots, one use only.
12.  3 **Blessed Seals.** Heavily decorated discs of stamped, gilded wax. A **mirrored paladin **may be able to make use of them. 1 slot total.
13.  **Book of Church Secrets.** An unpleasant accounting. Could be used as blackmail, or to get someone in a lot of trouble. Someone who might be you. 1/3 slot.
14.  **Prayer Beads.** Very soothing to fiddle with, grants **advantage** on saves against **fear** and the like when wielded. No slots, I think.
15.  **Censer.** Silver, ornate, suspended on three feet of fine chain. **Angels** and other **spells** are attracted to the scent of incense burned in it. 1 slot.
16.  **Cursed Incense.** Reminds any who smell it of their own mortality, and puts them in a foul mood. Not actually cursed, just universally culturally significant. 10 doses, no slots.
17.  **Pistol** and **shot** and **powder.** A **light** firearm which deals **1d8** damage, takes **4 full rounds** to reload, and can be safely fired in melee combat. 1/3 slot for the pistol itself, 1 slot each for 10 rounds and a horn with 10 doses of powder.
18.  A **Dog.** Man's best friend. Happy, friendly, **1 HD**, good at searching things out and eating garbage and not at all good at fighting. 3 slots if you have to carry it around for some reason.
19.  A **Horse.** Would ordinarily be man's other best friend, but this one is ill-tempered, cloven-hooved, long-tongued, fond of eating carrion, and refuses to be ridden. **3 HD**, much too big to carry.
20.  Something **weird**. Roll **1d6:**

1.  Golden wedding band. Powerfully cursed, has some weird writing inside it, attracts **ghosts** when worn. You're supposed to throw this into a pit at the heart of the Mountain, I think. No slots.
2.  The true Tao. You're not supposed to be able to write this down, but someone did on a scroll about **1'** wide and **3'** long and now nobody knows what to do with it. Solid (and inviolable) to **ghosts** and **spells**. 1/3 slot.
3.  Jeweler's loupe. Displays a number above the head of each person observed through it commensurate to the quality of their **kung fu**.
4.  Socks woven from the hair of a saint. Refuse to touch impure things, allowing you to (with practice) hover above the surface of seawater, uncut grass, &c. No slots.
5.  An endpaper torn from the first holy book. Completely blank, blackens in the presence of elfs and giants. Do not burn it. No slots.
6.  **NOT A SWORD**, name scratched crudely into scabbard. He is a **+0 heavy **sword (**2d6**) of make indeterminate due to being completely rusted into his scabbard. Believes he has been fighting an bitter war against completely imagined enemies for the past millennia. Doesn't count as bearing an edge, in case you're a **gunpowder paladin**.
