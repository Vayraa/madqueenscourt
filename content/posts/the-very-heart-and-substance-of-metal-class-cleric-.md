Class: Sacred Alchemist
=======================

> _Guilt upon the conscience, like rust upon **Iron**, both defiles and consumes it, gnawing and creeping into it, as that does which at last eats out the very heart and substance of the metal._

> **\-Robert South**, a cleric by most definitions 

You are a priest, a cleric, an **adherent** to to the cult of one of the **[sacred metals](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/what-noble-darkness-at-heart-of-man.html)** of creation. You are blessed with the ability to perceive, communicate with, and command **motes** (also known as **sprites **or **angels**) with **Metal Dice**, a process that functions exactly identically to that for casting spells with **Magic Dice. **You don't get any bonuses to-hit or anything like that.

  

**Skills:** Metalworking, Alchemy, and one of **1.** Natural Philosophy **2.** Logistics **3.** Oratory

  

**Starting Equipment:** As per adherence.

  

**A** Adherent, Alchemy, 1 MD  
**B** Friend, +1 MD

**C** Panic Brewing, +1 MD  
**D** Secretary, +1 MD

  

**A: Adherent**  
You are a member of a **holy cult**, and people know you as such by the garb and tools you bear. You may rely on the good nature of Kings and Men to feed and house you in any populated settlement, and may call upon your **order** for assistance when required.

  

You are also a **spellcaster**. You begin with the service of the mote known as _Homunculus_, and roll **1d6** on your cult's list for an additional spell at each template including **A**. If you get a duplicate, choose the next one above or below it that you don't already have.  
  
**A: Alchemy  
**When you come across a corpse, interesting plant, or other such thing you may spend **10 minutes** gathering a **reagent** from it. In addition, for every **watch** you spend traveling outside of civilization you may gather one random **ingredient** from the following list:  
  
            **1.** **Eyebark**. Causes a **sample**\-related shift to the affected's perceptions.

            **2.** **Ringleaf**. Physically manifests a **sample**\-related transformation in the affected.

            **3.** **Spaderoot**. Creates a **sample-**related vulnerability in the affected.

            **4.** **Clubseed**. Causes **sample**\-related harm to the affected.  
            **5.** **Heartberry**. Heals or cures **sample-**related maladies in the affected.  
            **6.** **Diamondfruit**. Fortifies the affected against **sample**\-related harm.

  

Each time you **rest**, you may combine one **reagent **with one **ingredient** in order to create a potion, salve, oil, or other alchemical substance. Negotiate its effects with your **GM**, then note down the recipe for future use. 

  

For example you might combine an **owl's beak** with **heartberry** to create a potion which cures blindness (owls have good vision), or with **spaderoot** to create a poison which causes those affected by it to become nightblind or gives them frail bones (owls have good nightvision and hollow bones), or with **clubseed** to create a damaging poison which causes small scratches to appear all over their body (owls have sharp beaks and talons). If a numerical effect is needed, healing potions typically heal **2d6 HP** and damaging poisons typically deal **+1d6** if applied to a weapon, **2d6** if thrown, or **4d6** if imbibed.

  

Whenever you have significant (more than a day) downtime in a town or city, all your collected **ingredients** go bad and you must restart your collection. The same does not apply to **reagents** unless obviously vulnerable to spoilage.

  

**B: ****Friend**

Choose one of your **spells** to become a close **friend**. When commanding them your **MD** exhaust only on a **5 **or a **6**, and they are usually willing to attempt tasks outside of their normal purpose (but within their capabilities) on your behalf. You may switch which of your **spells** is your **friend **each time you level up, if you choose.  
  
**C: Panic Brewing  
**You may perform your **alchemy** and _immediately_ apply/imbibe/etc the result in a single combat round, rather than over the course of a **rest**. There is a **2-in-6** chance of it causing a random **mishap** in addition to its normal effects.  

  

**D: Secretary**  
Your name is known throughout your **order** as a champion of your cause, and an acolyte or apprentice is sent to assist you. They are a level **2** Sacred Alchemist of the same adherence as yourself, played by the **GM**. Should they die, you will receive a replacement within **1d6** weeks along with a sternly worded letter of reprimand.

Orders of the Sacred Alchemist
------------------------------

1.  **Lead  
    **_You are a member of the death cult of **Lead**. It is your task to destroy Kung Fu. You are expected to remove magic from the world, by murder if necessary. You may travel with Wizards and Artists in order to hunt others of their kind, but it is your solemn duty to prevent them from escaping you at the last._  
    Starting Equipment: Two flintlock pistols (1 slot each, **2d6**, **30'** range), 10 pistol balls (1 slot), and powderhorn with 10 doses (1 slot), **blue** robes, and a **lead** teardrop pendant.  
    Perk: **Incoherent** undead will not attack you unless specifically directed, and you may roll **CHA** to give them orders. You may roll opposed **MD** (exhausting them as normal) in order to absorb **spells** that directly target you.  
    Drawback: Your soul is too heavy with Lead to properly bind to Gold - you gain no **experience points** from treasure. **Wizards** and [**Kings**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html) will send their [**assassins**](https://glass-candles.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-guilty-will-not-judge-themselves.html) after you should you attract too much attention to yourself (or automatically at template **D** if it hasn't started happening by then).  
    Spell List: _Homunculus_, plus:

1.  _Ail_
2.  _Bolt_
3.  _Cage_
4.  _Shield_
5.  _Smoke_
6.  _Transmute  
    _  
    

3.  **Copper**  
    _You are a priest of the Good Church of Mother **Copper**. It is your task to grant succor. You are expected to feed the hungry, tend the ill, shelter the homeless, and provide other aid when asked for or obviously required._  
    Starting Equipment: A **copper**\-bladed spear (2 slots, **1d10**, reach), a **red** and **green** woolen blanket which can be used as a robe, cloak, or bedroll, 3 rations (1 slot), a water canteen (1 slot), and a wine canteen (1 slot).  
    Perk: Food and water multiply when prepared by your hands; you can feed up to **10** with a single ration, and vessels of water and wine you bear will never run dry so long as they are not spilled or drank from greedily.  
    Drawback: You **may not** refuse simple aid (i.e. that which you could grant immediately) to those who ask for it genuinely; doing so causes you to be **doomed**.  
    Spell List: _Homunculus_, plus:

1.  _Extract_
2.  _Fabricate_
3.  _Locomote_
4.  _Mend_
5.  _Radiate_
6.  _Shield  
      
    _

5.  **Iron**  
    _You are an evangel of the **Iron** Church, which some call a cult. It is your task to spread the word of your Church and to save all human souls by destroying them. You are expected to argue theology, deface temples and shrines to other Powers, and desecrate corpses. But don't take any of it too seriously - **Iron** always wins in the end.  
    _Starting Equipment: A rifled musket (2 slots, **2d8**, **60'** range) with cruel bayonet (**1d8**), 10 paper rifle cartridges (1 slot), **ash-grey** robes including a mask or veil, and an **iron** spike.  
    Perk: You have **+1 to-hit**. This bonus increases to **+2** at template **C**. You may use **Iron** to destroy undead, as well as create them (it's all in the wrist).  
    Drawback: The corrupting influence of **Iron** has left you frail and sickly and scarred. You have **\-2 HP** per template, and the unprepared recoil when you drop your mask or veil.  
    Spell List: _Homunculus_, plus:

1.  _Berserk_
2.  _Bolt_
3.  _Cage_
4.  _Fabricate_
5.  _Locomote_
6.  _Ruin  
      
    _

7.  **Silver**  
    _You are a confessor of the_ **Argent** _Order. It is your task to conduct human souls through the final stages of their journeys. You are expected to banish undead, investigate conflict, pronounce judgement, perform last rites, and (of course) take final confessions._  
    Starting Equipment: A **medium **khopesh (1 slot, **1d8**), a polished breastplate (4 slots, **4 AC**), **black** robes, 3 vials of holy water (1 slot), and jingling **silver** spurs.  
    Perk: You can tell how long a corpse has been dead, how it died, and whether or not anyone has performed its last rites at a glance. Civilized folk are legally bound (though not always willing) to let you poke around in their business and abide by your judgements, sort of like if you had an **FBI** badge in real life.  
    Drawback: You **must** tend to every dying person or corpse you encounter unless they have already had their last rites performed; failing to do so causes you to be **doomed**.  
    Spell List: _Homunculus_, plus:

1.  _Bolt_
2.  _Cage_
3.  _Extract_
4.  _Mend_
5.  _Shield_
6.  _Smoke  
      
    _

9.  **Mercury**  
    _You are a student of the **Mercurial** Path. It is your task to reach nirvana, spiritual enlightenment. You are expected to take drugs, meditate, and respond to queries with smug mysticism or slapstick violence._  
    Starting Equipment: A short compound bow (1 slot, **1d8**), 10 arrows (1 slot), martial artist's wrappings, a simple **white** robe, 3 doses of opium (1 slot, narcotic), 3 doses of henbane (1 slot, stimulant), 3 doses of fly algaric (1 slot, deliriant), drug paraphenalia (pipe, tea set, etc, 1 slot total), and a small vial of **mercury**.  
    Perk: While meditating, you enter a state of **suspended animation** during which you are approximately as aware of your surroundings as a sleeping person, require no food nor water, and are immune to environmental effects. Upon reaching template **D**, you also become immune to **damage** while in this state.  
    Drawback: For each day you do not consume at least **1 dose** of strong psychoactive substances, you take a cumulative **\-1 penalty** to all **d20 rolls** until you get real high again.  
    Spell List: _Homunculus_, plus:

1.  _Ail_
2.  _Berserk_
3.  _Extract_
4.  _Locomote_
5.  _Smoke_
6.  _Transmute  
      
    _

11.  **Gold**  
    _You are an initiate in the cult of **Gold**. It is your task to achieve power, of any kind, whatever the cost. You are expected to scheme, plot, seek out secret knowledge, serve dark powers and inevitably betray them, and amass wealth._  
    Starting Equipment: A **heavy** mace with **gilded** head (2 slots, **2d6**), rich **purple** robes, a fine mink or ermine cloak (1 slot), a **golden** diadem or tiara, and a bottle of fine wine (1 slot).  
    Perk: Your soul is porous and greedy like a sponge, binding easily to blood and **gold**. You gain double **experience points** from treasure and monsters.  
    Drawback: You **may not** willingly give up wealth, power, or proffer aid without compensation; doing so causes you to be **doomed**.  
    Spell List: _Homunculus_, plus:

1.  _Ail_
2.  _Fabricate_
3.  _Mend_
4.  _Radiate_
5.  _Ruin_
6.  _Transmute_

_Twist: The monkey is the Sacred Alchemist and the old guy is the spell. ;B)  
by __[RUIHENGLIU](https://www.zbrushcentral.com/t/magician/206387)_

Motes of Sacred Alchemy
-----------------------

Where these spells refer to **metal**, substitute the material of the Power you serve. These are, of course, merely the **motes** you have immediate access to. Additional ones may be found in the wild and pressed into service.

*   **Homunculus**  
    _He is a spindly mannekin constructed from the sacred metal of the cleric he serves. Homunculi (for unlike other **motes**, these are markedly individual) tend to take on the prominent features of their masters—this one hunched and wizened, that one fond of wine and ostentatious dress..._  
    Familiar (ho, oho) to all Sacred Alchemists, _Homunculus_ is a loyal companion and dedicated, if sometimes clumsy, helper. He may be called upon to exert up to **\[sum\]** pounds of force on objects within a stone's throw, and is easily bribed with **MD** to perform assorted miscellaneous tasks. Notably, his personal connection to you makes him especially useful for negotiating—or enlisting—wild **motes** into your service.  
    

1.  **Ail**  
    _She is sinister in appearance, hunchbacked and wrapped in the rags of a leper. She causes her effects with the raising of a withered hand._  
    Renders up to **\[dice\] HD** worth of targets within sight slow, frail, and sickly, halving their maximum **HP** and limiting them to **one action** per round. They may roll **STR** in order to suffer only one of the effects (their choice) rather than both. _Ail_ lasts for a duration dependent on the number of **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD** - **\[sum\]** rounds.
*   **2 MD** - **\[sum\]** hours.
*   **3 MD** - **\[sum\]** days.
*   **4 MD** - Permanent.  
      
    

3.  **Berserk**  
    _She is steel-skinned, wild-eyed, swollen with vein and muscle. Foam pours from her gnashing teeth and she moves with twitchy, erratic purpose.  
    _Grants the target a **+\[dice\]** bonus to **melee attack** rolls, a **+\[highest\]** bonus to **melee damage**, and a **\-\[lowest\]** penalty to **AC** for **\[sum\]** rounds. They must make all available melee attacks, but may attempt one **CHA** roll per round to end the effect early. You may command _Berserk_ without spending an **action**.  
      
    
4.  **Bolt**  
    _She is grim of countenance, armed and armored for war. Her eyes are tired, and her hands steady._  
    Fires **\[dice\]** bolts of solid **metal** which fly preternaturally fast and true on trails of sparks and acrid smoke. Each does damage equal to the the **\[sum\]** of one **MD** with no save or attack roll and can be allocated to the target of your choice. Can also be used for riveting, outside of combat applications.  
    **Lead** bolts resemble: **1\.** Bullets**2.** Snakes** 3.** Teardrops** 4.** Weights  
    **Iron** bolts resemble: **1.** Railroad spikes **2\.** Razor blades **3.** Framing nails **4\.** Industrial staples  
    **Silver** bolts resemble: **1\.** Spears **2\.** Arrows **3.** Dueling swords **4.** Bladed crescents  
      
    
5.  **Cage**  
    _She is stern-featured and bears a small birdcage with a bell hung within. Metal straps are riveted across her face in a 2" square pattern._  
    Encases a target that would fit within a **\[dice\] \* 10'** cube in a cage of flash-forged potmetal. The cage has **\[sum\] HP**, ignores **\[dice\]** damage from each attack or other instance, and is permanent until destroyed.  
      
    
6.  **Extract**  
    _She wears a simple white shift, and has kind but piercing eyes. One hand holds a scalpel and the other a long pipette._  
    Extracts the named material from the touched target, and places it in a designated vessel if you desire. If used to extract something integral she deals **\[sum\]** damage, **STR** half, and requires a successful **melee** attack to use on an unwilling target. If used to extract poison or drugs, it just works. Negotiate other use cases with your **GM** as they occur.  
      
    
7.  **Fabricate**  
    _She is clad in leather apron, toolbelts, a large rucksack, all filled with tools and trinkets and conspiring to nearly obscure her entire form.  
    _Creates up to **\[sum\]** inventory slots worth of low-quality potmetal items or equipment, so fragile that each individual piece will break irreparably after one use. Alternately, creates **\[dice\]** inventory slots of slightly-higher-quality objects, each sturdy enough to last until a **fumble** is rolled and capable of holding moderate detail.  
      
    
8.  **Locomote**  
    _She is a jet-black, her massive head mounted on a roughly cylindrical body, her lower and rear parts disappearing in a maelstrom of churning levers and spinning wheels. She speaks in a piercing howl, accompanied by a deafening crescendo of pounding metal._  
    Instantaneously transports up to **\[dice\]** targets (including you, if desired) **\[sum\] \* 10'** in a straight line. Everything in the path takes **\[sum\]** damage, **DEX** half. If the transported would end up inside a solid object which was not destroyed by this damage, they take the same.  
      
    
9.  **Mend  
    _She is sturdily built, wearing a simple apron and a leather cap. She carries a rod-and-serpent in her left hand and a hammer in her right._  
    Restores \[sum\] + \[dice\] HP** to the target, whether organic or inorganic. Alternately, can be directed to solve specific problems dependent on the number of **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD** - Fix superficial damage.
*   **2 MD** - Mend broken bones, reconstitute detailed surfaces.
*   **3 MD** - Cure maladies such as disease and curses, mend complex details like artwork.
*   **4 MD** - Reattach recently severed limbs, reconstitute ruined devices.
*   **5 MD** - Regrow missing limbs or organs, restore completely destroyed objects.  
      
    

11.  **Radiate**  
    _She is slender and completely hairless, clad in a loose, gauzy shift. Her skeleton is starkly visible through her skin and garment. She perceives the world in wavelengths impossible to us, and does not understand the fragility of humans.  
    _Causes the targeted object within a stone's throw to radiate energy for up to **\[sum\]** hours, of a type dependent on how many **MD** were invested in her:
    
    *   **1 MD** - Casts **bright** illumination out to **60'**, warms like a hearth.
    *   **2 MD** - Casts **bright** illumination within sight range, counts as **sunlight**, warms like a pyre.
    *   **3 MD** - Casts invisible rays of **blinding heat**, deals **\[dice\]** damage per round within **60'**, any who look at it within that range roll **STR** or are permanently blinded. Blocked by anything sufficiently opaque.
    *   **4 MD** - Casts intangible rays of **poison fire**, deals **\[dice\] STR** damage per round within **30'** to all targets, including **spells**, et cetera. Only blocked by lead or stone.
    
      
    
12.  **Ruin**  
    _She is crudely formed, as if pieced together from scrap clay by an inexpert sculptor. Over-fond of complex plans and mechanisms. Thinks she's smarter than she is._  
    Rots, shatters, withers, or otherwise destroys targeted objects within earshot, and is capable of wreaking an amount of destruction relative to the **MD** invested in her:
    
    *   **1 MD** - A few blows with a hammer (A handheld object, an artwork)
    *   **2 MD** - Two folks with tools (A door, a chest, a sarcophagus)
    *   **3 MD** - A half-dozen tradesfolk with block and tackle (A tunnel, a wooden building, an architectural feature)
    *   **4 MD** - A dozen tradesfolk with heavy equipment (A stone building or fortification, a large cavern)
    
      
    
13.  **Shield**  
    _She is concealed under, or perhaps comprised of, ornamented plate with complex joints, and speaks of love and care with a hard edge in her voice. Her namesake is likewise decorated, a great disk bearing reliefs of heroism in intricate detail._  
    Defends you or a target of your choice within arm's reach for up to **\[sum\]** hours, granting a **+\[dice\]** bonus to **AC** and completely negating direct-damage **spells**.  
      
    
14.  **Smoke**  
    _She is beatific in manner, wreathed in opaque clouds of solid white and black, clad in an unfamiliar work-uniform with militaristic detailing. Her eyes are closed._  
    Creates a **\[dice\] \* 30'** radius cloud of opaque smoke which lasts for **\[sum\]** hours, or **\[dice\]** minutes in strong wind. The effects of the smoke are otherwise dependent on the **MD** invested in her:

*   **1 MD** - The smoke is sufficient to obscure details (faces, etc) and apply **disadvantage** to ranged attacks made through it.
*   **2 MD** - The smoke is sufficient to obscure objects more than **5'** away in their entirety.
*   **3 MD** - The smoke is thick enough to conceal an outstretched hand, and completely opaque to supernatural vision.
*   **4 MD** - The smoke deals **\[best\]** damage to creatures other than you with every breath, and they must roll **STR** each round or be struck permanently blind if it contacts their eyes directly. When commanded with this number of MD, _Smoke _instead answers to the name _Cloudkill_.  
      
    

16.  **Transmute**  
    _She is blindfolded, four-armed and resplendent with alchemical symbolism, bearing a tattoo of each element on the palm of one hand. She is crowned with a circlet of a material that cannot be described, which bears an empty socket above her brow where a gemstone would be set._  
    Transforms the touched target into _something else_. Regardless of change, she cannot grant magical or supernatural abilities. If an inanimate object is transformed into something living, use fairytale logic—rocks are slow and grumbly, tools are helpful and pragmatic, &c.  
      
    For reasons unknown to all, _Transmute_ refuses to work on any of the **sacred metals**. Legend holds that the **philosopher's stone** is key to unlocking the full extent of her power. Perhaps, in the meantime, a lesser stone might have some lesser effect?  
      
    For each **MD** invested in her, choose to spend it on **difference** or **duration:**

*   **Difference**

*   **0 MD** - Same nature, different appearance (sword to different type of sword, human to different human, pine to other pine).
*   **1 MD** - Same size and type (sword to axe, human to chimpanzee, pine to spruce).
*   **2 MD** - Change size OR type slightly (sword to shield or dagger, human to gorilla or baby human, pine to oak).
*   **3 MD** - Similar size and type (sword to waterskin or wheelbarrow, human to dog or warhorse, pine to hawthorn).
*   **4 MD** - Different size and type (sword to earring or sailing ship, human to dragon, pine to daisy).
*   **5 MD** - Different size and kingdom (sword to dragon, human to silver spoon, pine to human).

*   **Duration**

*   **0 MD** - **\[sum\]** rounds.
*   **1 MD** - **\[sum\]** minutes.
*   **2 MD** - **\[sum\]** hours.
*   **3 MD** - **\[sum\]** days.
*   **4 MD** - Permanent.

Alchemical Complications
------------------------

### **Mishaps**

1.  Metal in your possession becomes uncomfortably hot, burning you for **1** damage per round until dropped or doffed.
2.  Your muscles seize and air expels itself from your lungs in great hacking coughs, **stunning** you for **2** rounds.
3.  You catch fire, taking **1d6 **damage immediately and a further **1d6** per round until extinguished.
4.  Metals in your possession become corrupted; **Gold** becomes **Lead**, **Mercury** becomes **Tar**, **Silver** becomes **Tin**, **Iron** becomes **Glass**, **Copper** becomes **Wood**, and **Lead** is unaffected.
5.  You become wreathed in a sickly glow, casting light as a **candle** and causing **undead** and **dumb animals** to attack you on sight or flee (as appropriate) until the next time you **rest**.
6.  You are stricken with a **mutation**. **Save** or it's semi-permanent - the next time you get this result, lose it and roll **N+1** new **mutations**.

### **Dooms**

1.  Your surface turns to the Power you serve, granting you **+2 AC**. The touch of your naked skin rots and corrodes metals, ruining them.
2.  Your organs turn to the substance of your Power, granting you a further **+2 AC** and rendering you immune to **sleep**, **hunger**, **thirst**, **disease**, **poison**, **having to breathe**, and **aging**. Your touch rots and corrodes metal even through clothing or other protectants.
3.  Your entire self turns to **sacred metal**, body and soul. You become an inanimate statue (or puddle, if you serve **Mercury**).

Your **doom** may be avoided by finding the **elixir of life**, **philosopher's stone**, **panacea**, **universal solvent**, or other greatly sought-after Alchemical goal.
