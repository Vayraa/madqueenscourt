With apologies to Arnold K and Skerples; I have done a very ill-advised and possibly unholy thing.  
  
I have grafted bits of [D&D 3.5 AKA the d20 system](https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm) (because that's what I grew up on and still informs a lot of my tastes) to the [GL](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html)[OG](http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html).

It's called [the Goblin Ruins Of Gaming, or the GROG, and you can get it right here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvTAQxdi0GP0QwheUiQbMDyMzwvWF8iM/view)  
  
And shit, I guess you need a [Character Sheet. Here's that.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5OhTRpLOhkT77ahIIt5CxjKaaMOkDFb/view?usp=sharing)  
  
Notable features AKA "what makes this different from every other GLOGhack or indeed OSR-adjacent ruleset"  

*   Four base stats! Modifiers only! Basically point-buy!
*   Complex combat rules! Grappling rules!
*   It's only 8 pages including the cover!
*   The header font is called Goblin One!

There's no content in here, but I was writing a whole game and setting as a d20hack and I think I'll shift it over to this because I like it better so expect bits of that soon.  
  
**EDIT:** Ironically, about seven minutes after I published this, Arnold [posted](https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/stat-squish-and-lawful-roll.html) that he was abandoning roll-under for the GLOG in favor of only having modifiers. The d20hack I am abandoning only had modifiers (although it was a much more standard-for-d20 roll-to-beat-arbitrary-DC system). All things are thus in balance.  
  
**EDIT EDIT****:**  
I've updated the ruleset as of 2020-05-21, after running some playtesting.  
  
**EDIT EDIT EDIT:**

Well, here we are, nearly a year later (2021-05-01) and I've rewritten the whole damn thing to be a lot simpler. Gone are the novel dice mechanics and weapon tags, which feels like killing a part of me but it's a part that had to die. Also, oops, back to modifiers-only stats. Hah.
