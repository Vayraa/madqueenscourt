Holy shit, I'm done. This is the player's handbook/player handout for the game I'm preparing to run.  
  
It's written for the [GROG (my GLOGhack)](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html) and reproduces some rules from it. It's probably high-powered for most GLOG games but still broadly compatible.

And shit, I guess you need a [Character Sheet. Here's that.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5OhTRpLOhkT77ahIIt5CxjKaaMOkDFb/view?usp=sharing)  
  
 Here's what's in here:

*   3 (7) PC species: Goblinoid (Bugbear, Hobgoblin, Goblin), Orc ("True", Water, Half), Moth Elf
*   4 (11) PC classes: Paladin (Bard, Ranger/Barbarian, Monk, Wizard), Witch (Gun, Bug, Friend, Cancer), False Witch (Sword, Bottle), Gutter Knight

*   With players "unlocking" more species and classes from the Bestiary (next on my list) through play

*   5 spellcasting Dooms (Sun, Fish, Blood, Ashes, Bones)
*   20-entry spellcasting Chaos/Mishap table
*   20-entry witch/monster weakness table
*   20-entry witch-tulpa table (probably fairly easy to adapt for [Skerples' Summoner](https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-100-entities-you-can-summon.html) or [3.5e Binders](https://dndtools.net/classes/binder/))
*   20-entry magic sword table
*   20-entry bottle-ghost table (captured souls)
*   20-entry patch-favor table (symbolic tokens given to knights that summon or do things)
*   Full arms and armor tables with regional namelists, using my [overcomplicated melee weapon type rules](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html)
*   42 classic D&D spells converted to GLOG (albeit probably most or all ones that have already been done by other people)
*   public domain illustrations from old books
