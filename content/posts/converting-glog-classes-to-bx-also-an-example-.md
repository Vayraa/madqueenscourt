It has come to my attention that some people don't understand how to play GLOG classes in B/X (or OSE, as the case may be). They labor under the mistaken assumption that you have to "convert" them, and need "guidance" to do so.

**This is eminently false.**  

But in the service of accessibility and reducing the number of falsehoods that are present on this earth, I will explain.

You don't have to convert them at all.
--------------------------------------

That's pithy, but almost true. More accurately, the conversion is one step in the simplest cases, and like, three in the most complex:

_[Wizzzargh](http://wizzzargh.blogspot.com/) is talking about BFRPG, not B/X, but the same principles apply. Also I played in their game; it worked just fine._

  

Here, I will give you some examples.
------------------------------------

_This is a class from the inimitable [Jojiro](https://dungeonantology.com/)'s [Red Box Rogues](https://jojiro.itch.io/red-box-rogues). It doesn't matter what B/X source you use, this works fine with the OSE classic 4 classes or whatever._

  

That's a B/X class, right? Warm. Safe. Comfortable.

But let's say, hypothetically, for the sake of argument, that our pl\*yers (base and loathsome creatures that they are) want to play something cool and interesting instead. Let's say they want to play [Shivas of Gunses](https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2019/12/you-sprout-bouquet-of-gun-wielding-arms.html). We're using this as an example because it's exceptionally weird, being fighter-y but also wizard-y. If you can convert this, you can convert anything.

Excellent. 

**Step Zero:** Remove all the stuff you're going to change. In this case, a complex one, we're cutting fucking everything.

Nice.

**Step one (optional):** **If** you're combining classes, put the combined elements in there. I think Shivas of Guns should have **Magic-User** experience/level and HD, since they do spells sort of; **Thief** saves, armor proficiency, and prime requisite, since they're nimble; and **Guns** as a weapon proficiency, for obvious reasons. If you're converting something that's more obviously "just a wizard" or "just a fighter" or whatever, **you can skip this step**.

**Step One (Point Five):** This is also a good time to put the name of the class in.

This is what we've got so far:

Good stuff.

**Step Two (Mandatory):** Put all the abilities of the GLOG class in, converting references to **templates** to references to **level** as you go.

Bam! And we made a whole fancy layout that we didn't need, even. This is a simple enough process that you can honestly just write down:  

> **SHIVA OF GUNS  
> PRIME REQ:** DEX  
> **ARMOR:** LEATHER, NO SHIELDS  
> **WEAPONS:** GUNS, KNIVES  
> **HD/EXP:** AS M-U  
> **THAC0:** AS FIGHTER  
> **SAVES:** AS THIEF

Hell, for most classes you can cut that down to one line: **STUFF:** AS <CLASS> 

And would you look at that, we're done!
