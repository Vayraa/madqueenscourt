A continuation of the Work of preparing PC classes for the **[Mountain](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html)**. These in particular are archetypes for my **[Ultimate Thief](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html)** and **[Fighter](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html)**.

  

False Witches. They're called Witches because they use magic. They're called False because they aren't actually magical at all themselves. They are, basically, specialists or thieves or rogues or what have you. Scientists. People who have figured out how to manipulate the world in specific ways, without ever performing something that we'd call magic directly.

  

They're a lot easier to run out of town or burn at the stake, etc, than real witches are.

_Five of Swords._

Archetype: Sword Witch
----------------------

> _The sword is the ultimate tool—you can hunt with them, eat with them, use them to start a fire or cut down a tree, and they’re the primary symbol of skill at arms across the world. _

This is a [**Thief**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html) archetype, properly speaking, but I suppose I can't _really_ stop you from jamming it on something else.

  

Starting Equipment: **A MAGIC SWORD**, a **normal sword**,** dark clothing**, a **waterskin** and **3 days trail rations**, a **bullseye lantern** and **flint** and **oil**, **soft boots**, and a **cloak**. 

Benefit: You can carry any number of swords tied into a bundle in the space of the largest single one you possess, and draw blades from it unerringly without spending an action. You can identify all properties of a blade by fucking around with it for an hour. If you didn't speak **[swordsong](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html)** already, you do now.

Drawback: Your **opportunism** only works on sword attacks. Sword-wielders will be naturally jealous of you.

_Seven of Cups._

Archetype: Bottle Witch
-----------------------

> _The drunk who waves his bottle, saying, it’s mine, I bought it with the money from my wages (paid by private or State institutions), while he is a victim of the Capital form, is also a usufructuary traitor to the health of the species. And so is the idiot who smokes cigarettes! Such “property” will be eliminated from the higher organization of society._

This, also, is intended as a [**Thief**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html) archetype.

  

Starting Equipment: A **ghost** in **ghost-bottle**, an **empty ghost-bottle**, **priming reagents** for ghost-bottles, a **shovel**, a **prybar,****dark clothing**, a **waterskin** and **3 days trail rations**, a **bullseye lantern** and **flint** and **oil**, **soft boots**, and a **cloak**. 

Benefits: You can prepare **ghost-bottles**, and use them with less risk than anyone else.

Drawbacks: Those who care about the final fate of their souls will be naturally wary of you.

  

### Ghost-Bottles

Priming a ghost-bottle for use requires an empty ghost-bottle and one hour of focused work with access to open flame and simple reagents (lead, antimony, rock salt, water, bitter nightshade, and a bit of blood).

  

Ghost-bottles take up **1/3** inventory slot each. The priming reagents take up **1** slot in total.

  

Once primed, a ghost-bottle may be used to capture **dying souls**, **ghosts**, **demons**, **spells**, **elementals**, or **angels** if opened toward them at exactly the right moment. For most people this would take some combination of a **DEX** check (to get the timing right) and an opposed **CHA** roll (to overpower the ghost), but the first isn't a problem for bottle witches as long as they're prepared and the second isn't a problem as long as they're not trying to catch an emperor or an archdemon etc.

  

Once captured, a **bottle-ghost** may be used in one of several ways:

*   You can **drink** it. This kills the bottle-ghost, heals you, will probably have other effects, and is rightly seen by all intelligent creatures as an _incredibly_ evil act.
*   You can **let it go** for good. This empties the ghost-bottle, so you can prime it to capture another ghost.
*   You can send it to **scout** a nearby area. This takes **10 minutes**, after which the ghost will return to its bottle with **1d6** pieces of information. Ghosts are best at sensing spellcasters, powerful magic, and other spiritual beings, and very bad at sensing architecture and mundane items—and will return information in approximately this order. This is usually safe, unless something that can both see and affect ghosts is in the area to be scouted.
*   You can send it to **haunt** a creature. The ghost and its target roll opposed **CHA**—if the ghost wins, it imposes a penalty equal to its **HD** on all actions the target takes. Should the target die while being haunted, the ghost will attempt to **possess** it (as below)—if the ghost fails, it **dissipates permanently**.
*   You can attempt to have it **possess** something. The ghost and its target roll opposed **CHA**—if the ghost wins, it now controls the target's actions. If the target is of equal **HD** to the ghost or better, the target may try again each round until successful—at which point the ghost **dissipates** **permanently**. Ghosts possessing a body are under no obligation to their bottle-witch and may be hostile, particularly if recently captured. Inanimate or unconscious targets don't get to save.
*   Maybe it can do **something else**, depending on who it is. These additional abilities—active ones—are only usable once per 'scene' or so; a ghost needs time to rest.

All of these are technically possible for non-bottle-witches to accomplish, but much riskier and likely to result in the ghost dissipating permanently regardless of outcome.

_Eight of Cups._

Archetype: Mask Witch
---------------------

> _Some students do not realize the true man in a mask_
> 
> _Because they recognize ego-soul._
> 
> _Ego-soul is the seed of birth and death,_
> 
> _And foolish people call it the true man._

This, also also, is intended as a [**Thief**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html) archetype.

  

Starting Equipment: A **corpse-mask**, a **regular mask**, three very sharp **knives** in various sizes, a formidable **sewing kit**,a bottle of **formaldehyde**, **dark clothing**, a **waterskin** and **3 days trail rations**, a **bullseye lantern** and **flint** and **oil**, **soft boots**, and a **cloak**. 

Benefits: You can prepare **corpse-masks**, and wear them to gain strange powers.

Drawbacks: Those who care about the final fate of their bodies will be naturally wary of you.

  

### Corpse-Masks

Someone who knows how (that's you) can make a death mask out of someone's face with the aid of a good sewing kit and a wood or bone frame in, I don't know, about an hour, maybe longer if they've got a significantly different sized head. Someone who knows how (also you) can gain certain powers or abilities from wearing said mask. These two skills do not ordinarily coreside in the same person. That makes you special.

  

The bare minimum effect for a corpse-mask is **+1** to the highest stat of the corpse it was made from, while you wear it. More often, they'll give you a weird little passive ability instead. Exceptionally powerful corpse-masks may even have _some_ effect when worn by a non-mask-witch.

  

Masks take up **1/3** slot each, and the sewing kit is another **1/3**. Switching between masks takes at least an **action**, even if you've got them all handy.

  

### 1d10 Starting Corpse-Masks

1.  **Ass**—Gain **+1 STR**.
2.  **Dancer**—Gain **+1 DEX**.
3.  **Giant Raven**—Gain **+1 INT**.

6.  **Giant Owl**—Can do the **spooky head thing**, and see just fine in starlight.
7.  **Wolf**—Gain a bite attack for **1d6** damage, double that against creatures that speak a [**civilized tongue** or **Arqot**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html).
8.  **Bear**—Gain **+2 STR**.
9.  **Giant Buzzard**—Can eat carrion with no risk or displeasure.
10.  **[GIANT SPIDER AAAAAA](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/05/no-light-no-warmth-giant-spider-ii.html)**—Gain one **adaptation** rolled from the list.

_Knight of Disks._

Archetype: Gutter Knight
------------------------

> _The ancient kings secured good government of their kingdoms through learning of honor, of humility, of virtue, and by acting charitably to those lesser than they. __It is the duty of every great knight, to find a quest in life, and brave the demons of the age._

This is not a thief archetype. It's not even really a false witch. Certainly nobody is calling gutter knights witches and running them out of town. Quite the opposite, in fact. This is intended as an archetype of **[Ultimate Fighter](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html)**. 

  

Gutter knights are a part of the noble caste of the civilized world, scions of great houses of the [**River Kingdoms**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-9th-orcs-river-and-otherwise.html) and [**Charter Nations**](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-3rd-goblins-of-civilized-lands.html). They journey and commit acts of conspicuous heroism as a coming-of-age ritual, before eventually hanging up their cloak and returning to take their place in the gentry; theoretically humbled and made wiser by their experience. In practice few venture far from home, but some—more dedicated or naive than most, or attempting to distinguish themselves from their siblings—do wind up on the shores of the **[Mountain](https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html)**. 

  

There is no moth elf nobility, but some individuals have taken up the tradition nonetheless—their blades rusted and crudely made, their armor unpolished, their quilted favor-cloaks bedraggled, tattered and nearly bare, and their actions unbound by the centuries of tradition that weigh heavily on other gutter knights.

  

Starting Equipment: A **signet ring**and**sealing wax**, a **heavy** steel **longsword**, **odachi**, or **zhanmadao**, a masterfully crafted** plate cuirass****,**an **ostentatious formal outfit**, a set of **well-crafted traveling clothes**, a fine **tabard**,  **silk pyjamas**, your **quilted favor-cloak** and a **single patch-favor**, **jewelry** worth **300 sp**, an **astrolabe**, a **sextant**, **spyglass**, **compass**, and **map** each in their own carrying case, and **no food or water**. Moth elf "gutter knights" have regular equipment instead, besides the favor-cloak.

Benefits: You can carry and use **patch-favors**, tokens of magical appreciation for your errantry. Unless you are a moth elf, you may rely on your **family name** to secure respect, food, lodging, and **knightly quests** in any settlement large enough to have a mayor.

Drawbacks: You are not permitted to carry **any currency** nor possess **any items not carried by you personally** with the exception of a mount, saddle, and riding tack. Unless you are a moth elf, you may not strike a **surprised**, **surrendered**, or **helpless** humanoid foe.

  

### Patch-Favors

A patch-favor is a little scrap of canvas, linen, or burlap, painted or embroidered with a token. They are traditionally granted to gutter knights for the completion of **knightly quests**, but if there's nobody around capable or willing of creating one the gutter knight is permitted to make their own to commemorate a particularly noble deed.

  

Patch-favors take an **action** to pull from one's quilted favor-cloak and slap on something within arm's reach. They require contact with both the gutter knight and their intended target to activate, so you can't put them on sticks or arrows and using them on unwilling targets is an** attack** made against **AC 10**. Each patch-favor can be used **once** per day.

  

This power allegedly comes from deals struck between noble bloodlines and fey courts in ages long-past, and patch-favors do not function in the hands of anyone but a gutter knight.

  

### 1d12 Starting Patch-Favors

1.  **Torch**—For rescuing a peasant boy from a cave. Sets something on fire.
2.  **Paper Soldier**—For defending a library from book-burners. **Grapples** with **+5 STR**.

6.  **Windmill**—For putting out a village fire. Blows away anything not securely anchored to the ground.
7.  **Bathtub**—For running a pervert out of a brothel. Cleans target and gives it a delicate scent of flowers.
8.  **Bandage**—For binding the wounds of a wartime casualty. Heals **2d8** HP.
9.  **Dragon Scale**—For driving a pack of kobold raiders away from a monastery. Renders the target immune to fire for **1 hour**.
10.  **Rose**—For chasing off the unwanted suitor of a handmaiden. Creates a thorned thicket covering five contiguous **10'** squares.
11.  **Lance**—For slaying an ogre. Deals **4d8** damage.
12.  **Conch**—For cutting a nymph free of a fishing net. Summons **1d20** friendly sealions.
