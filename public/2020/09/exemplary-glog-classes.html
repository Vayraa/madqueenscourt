        <p><strong>Being a collection of my favorite GLOG classes written by others, in some sort of not-quite-exact order:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><a href="https://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-play-cleric.html"><strong>Religious classes</strong></a> - This isn&rsquo;t any single class in particular, but it&rsquo;s my favorite archetype. Read the post, your Clerics and Paladins and Especially Devout Characters Of Any Other Sort will all be leagues better for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything on <strong><a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/">Squig&rsquo;s blog</a>,</strong> particularly:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-gun-priest.html"><strong>Gun Priest</strong></a> - We all know about my love for playing <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/08/let-me-tell-you-about-my-d-characters.html">dedicated, arrogant, heretic religious nutjobs.</a> What&rsquo;s better than one of those? One of those with a gun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-sword-swallower.html"><strong>Sword-Swallower</strong></a> - Just dripping with flavor. If I had read this before writing my <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html">Sword Witch</a>, my Sword Witch would be better for it. As it is, I&rsquo;d probably let someone play one of these as an alt-Sword Witch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html"><strong>Sage</strong></a> - Absolutely stellar class for any developed and interesting setting. Great integration of narrative and exposition-focused mechanics into a playable class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Everything on <strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/">OSR Discord user deus ex parabola&rsquo;s blog</a>,</strong> particularly:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-unfinished-world-glog-campaign.html"><strong>Anything that interacts with his color-coded heresies</strong></a> - &ldquo;But Vayra!,&rdquo; you exclaim, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a setting element, not a class!&rdquo; And you&rsquo;re right, but that&rsquo;s how good it is. It&rsquo;s the single best piece of worldbuilding I&rsquo;ve ever seen committed to text. And anyway, there are <a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html"><strong>some Clerics</strong></a> for it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html"><strong>Guild Thug</strong></a> - The other guilds therein are also good, but the Guild Thug is a standout. There&rsquo;s something incredible to me about the idea of unionized 80&rsquo;s-era action movie baddies, sauntering up to dragons and liches to bop them in the knees and threaten them with destruction of property.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html"><strong>Metatron</strong></a> - Another excellent example of worldbuilding. Wizards, but they&rsquo;re some sort of absolutely nightmarish cold-war era fictive spy, and also (depending on interpretation) might have been replaced by a spiritual parasite. Put a Metatron in your campaign today. The implications are endless.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/05/full-glog-hack-vain-sword.html"><strong>Phlox&rsquo;s Acolyte</strong></a> - A refinement of <a href="https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-mind-is-horrible-thing-to-waste.html"><strong>Lexi&rsquo;s magic word-based Psion.</strong></a> Fixes several issues with the core one while retaining all of the things that made it interesting to me, ties it to a religious system (always a plus), and is just a complete blast to play. Not perfect, yet, maybe, but already great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Also the <a href="https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-barbarian.html"><strong>Barbarian-as-Foreigner.</strong></a> The list of advantages and disadvantages is incredible, awesome, great, very good, excellent, and other superlatives besides. I could see tacking that ability in particular on to other classes, perhaps in place of a &lsquo;race&rsquo; adjustment in an all-human setting, or the like.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/11/osr-necromancers.html"><strong>Skerples&rsquo; Necromancer</strong></a> - Sometimes, a necromancer is just a necromancer. This one has some interesting flavor about talking to dead folks, but the most important part of it is: it allows you to keep permanent undead servants at the cost of keeping your MD expended, or slowly (at risk of Doom) amass a permanent undead army of unlimited size. I consider this ability essential to anything that would call itself a necromancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2019/12/you-sprout-bouquet-of-gun-wielding-arms.html"><strong>Thorinp&rsquo;s Shiva of Guns</strong></a> - We know I like <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html">Gun Witches,</a> and this is my favorite one that isn&rsquo;t my own. It is particularly weird, in a very good way. &ldquo;You sprout a bouquet of gun wielding arms[&hellip;]&rdquo; indeed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://dungeonantology.com/2020/08/09/glog-class-design/"><strong>Jojiro&rsquo;s Iron Salamander</strong></a> - This is a good class design post, much like <strong><a href="http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/01/osr-how-to-design-glog-fighters.html">Phlox&rsquo;s earlier one</a>,</strong> but my favorite thing about it is this particular Fighter example: The Iron Salamander. Great stuff. Eminently flavorful. Powerful. Interesting.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, <strong>what are <em>your</em> favorite GLOG classes written by others?</strong> I know GLOG is somewhat imperfect for this question, as it encourages stealing bits and naturally your favorite version of a class will be the one that you cobbled together with parts of others, so perhaps it&rsquo;s best to think of it instead as: <strong>What GLOG classes most inspire you?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Other people have made this post, too!</strong></p>
