<p>I&rsquo;m not completely happy with this but I have determined to Just Post and fix it later, if it is determined to require fixing. Death to drafts!_</p>
<h2 id="_class-illuminated-paladin-purple-heretic_"><em>Class: Illuminated Paladin (Purple Heretic)</em> <a href="#_class-illuminated-paladin-purple-heretic_" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3WTGjrfvcgQ/X2aAMs3KVwI/AAAAAAAAqBY/NaHecIikBU4c678hnUoiqo6l2YcMAgeJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1047/purplemasks.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3WTGjrfvcgQ/X2aAMs3KVwI/AAAAAAAAqBY/NaHecIikBU4c678hnUoiqo6l2YcMAgeJgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h141/purplemasks.png" alt=""></a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Purple Heretics are a gnostic group. They believe their texts contain esoterica never revealed to the masses. In them, alcohol is prohibited and harems recommended. The g_ds&rsquo; disappearance is a puzzle to be solved, and those who do so will no doubt be among the elect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You&rsquo;re a follower of the Purple <em>Orthodoxy</em>Â and you&rsquo;re <em>damned proud of it.</em>Â You have come here in search of secrets, that you might know the truth of the world. You tattoo your skin and wear your mask proudly, for it marks you as one who isâ€”above all elseâ€”<strong>possessed of knowledge.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-play-cleric.html">This is how you should play every character with a link to the divine, but it&rsquo;sÂ <em>especially</em>Â how you should play an illuminated paladin.</a></p>
<p><strong>Tenets of the Purple Orthodoxy, in order of importance.</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do not, through action or inaction, allow error to be taught.</strong> Use fire if necessary. Ignore all other tenets if they would interfere with this, your most important goal.</li>
<li>Do not share information with the unworthy or those who would misuse it.</li>
<li>Seek out ancient tomes and ruins; do not allow information to be lost or forgotten.</li>
<li>Correct those who are under false impressions, unless this would interfere with the second tenet.</li>
<li>Accumulate libraries and stores of secret information, unless this would break the third tenet.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you take off your mask or break a tenet, you can&rsquo;t use any Illuminated Paladin class features except <strong>fieldwork</strong>Â andÂ **extra attack per roundÂ **until you put your mask back on <strong>and</strong>Â do at least three of: Edit a text, learn something new and important, point out to someone how they&rsquo;re wrong, eat a solid meal, stay awake for an entire night.</p>
<p>For every template of this class you have, you gainÂ **+1 SKLL.Â **You use theÂ <strong>specialist</strong>Â to-hit progression, increasing byÂ <strong>+1</strong>Â at templatesÂ <strong>B</strong>Â andÂ <strong>D.</strong> If you have at least one template in this class you can never fumble while using <strong>fencing weapons</strong>Â or **firearms.Â **YouÂ <strong>can&rsquo;t wear armor</strong> unless you have training or templates in another class that lets you.</p>
<p>**Starting Equipment:Â **A purple mask (see image), academic robes, burglar&rsquo;s clothing, soft leather boots and gloves, a parrying dagger (<strong>light</strong>), tattoo kit, writing supplies, a regular holy book (from the Church), an irregular holy book (from your mentor), a very irregular holy book (which you are writing),Â and one otherÂ <strong>academic implement</strong>Â chosen from the list at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Papermaking, Bookbinding, Calligraphy, and Illumination <strong>plus</strong>Â one of:Â 1. History, 2. Historiography, 3. Law.</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>Â Fieldwork, Illuminated (1 Truth)</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong>Â Erudition, Pointed Criticism, +1 Truth</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong>Â Confession,Â Extra Attack Per Round, +1 Truth</p>
<p><strong>D:</strong>Â Hypotheses, Thought Library, +1 Truth</p>
<p><strong>A: Fieldwork</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve trained for this. YouÂ have aÂ **3-in-6Â **chanceÂ of picking a common lock (<strong>2-in-6</strong>Â for something more secure,Â <strong>1-in-6</strong>Â for a safe or the like) and aÂ **1-in-6Â chanceÂ **to understand any specific bit of language you don&rsquo;t knowâ€”like a page in a book, inscription on a ring, occult chanted phrase, or passage gleaned through <strong>Erudition</strong>â€”that you encounter. Both of these chances improve byÂ <strong>1-in-6</strong>Â for each additional template of this class beyondÂ <strong>A.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Illuminated</strong></p>
<p>For everyÂ template of this class you have, one-quarter of your body&rsquo;s external surface area is covered in illuminated tattoos depicting one of the most important Truths you know. Roll on the Truth table for specifics at each template. If you roll a duplicate, choose the next non-duplicate Truth above or below it.</p>
<p>If one of your Truths is ever proven false, you lose the benefit of that Truth until you can have the tattoo corrected.</p>
<p><strong>B: Erudition</strong></p>
<p>The first time you touch any given text, you immediately know the most importantÂ <strong>107 sequential words</strong>Â contained therein. You can read a text of any length in one hour as long as you have a quiet place to sit and no interruptions, and identify places where a text has been edited or redacted at a glance.</p>
<p><strong>B: Pointed Criticism</strong></p>
<p>You study your enemies carefully, and are adept at using this knowledge to throw them off balance and erode their will to fight. For each <strong>name</strong>Â or <strong>horrible secret</strong>Â of a target that you correctly declare to them before making your first attack, you have <strong>+1</strong> to hit themÂ and they have <strong>-1</strong> to hit you  and on <strong>Morale</strong> checks.</p>
<p><strong>Names</strong>Â are any names that the target has been known byâ€”like full name, pseudonyms, and epithets; not first, middle, and last. <strong>Horrible secrets</strong>Â are anything that they would rather you not knowâ€”like shameful habits, past failures, and uncomfortable associations, each of which must be distinct from any others mentioned.</p>
<p>This ability applies to debates and arguments as well as physical combat, but only works against targets that are capable of understanding you.</p>
<p><strong>C: Confession</strong></p>
<p>For every ten minutes that you engage someone in spirited discussion, debate, or argument, you can ask them one question which they must answer and answer truthfully. RollÂ <strong>CHA</strong>Â orÂ <strong>INT,</strong>Â whichever is more advantageous for youâ€”if you succeed, they don&rsquo;t realize that you asked the question, or that they answered it.</p>
<p><strong>D: Hypotheses</strong></p>
<p>Given ten minutes of meditation, you can commune with <strong>angels</strong>Â to pronounce a <strong>hypothesis.</strong>Â The GM will tell you whether your <strong>hypothesis</strong> is <strong>true, partially true, or false.</strong> If it is <strong>false,</strong> you first take damage equal to your current <strong>Falsehoods</strong>, then increase your **FalsehoodsÂ **by <strong>107.</strong></p>
<p>Your <strong>Falsehoods</strong>Â decreases by <strong>1</strong> for each point of damage you take from any source, and each time you read or burn a text you had not already read or burn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>D: Thought Library</strong></p>
<p>When you interact with texts owned or possessed by someone else, any changes you makeâ€”placing, removing, editing, et ceteraâ€”are reflected in their actual memory. Doing so has similar effects to one of the twoÂ <strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html">Signature Techniques</a></strong>Â of the <strong>Company</strong>Â as performed with <strong>1</strong>Â or <strong>2 Memory Dice.</strong> Which <strong>Signature Technique</strong>Â and how many <strong>MD</strong>Â you roll depend on what exactly you are doing.If rolled with 2, you suffer any <strong>Mistakes</strong>Â as an actual Metatron would.</p>
<h3 id="truths">Truths <a href="#truths" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><p>When you gain a Truth, write down what you think<strong>are completely sure</strong>Â it is. You have to be careful about your Truths, particularly once you have access toÂ <strong>Hypotheses</strong>Â orÂ if you have aÂ <a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html">Sage</a>Â or 4-templateÂ <a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-gun-priest.html">Gun Priest</a>Â around.</p>
<p>These (or at least their names) will need to be replaced for other campaigns. They should be major questions about the setting that are understood well enough to be asked but not answered.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>The existence of the Soul.</strong><br>
Your tattooed skin can interact with ghosts, spells, angels, et cetera as if they existed physically, and your melee attacks deal full damage to undead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The fates of the G_ds.</strong><br>
You haveÂ <strong>+1 AC</strong>Â per template, which doesn&rsquo;t stack with normal armor. When someone you knew the name of dies, their name appears on your right arm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The identity of the Fifth Brother.</strong><br>
Your mask is unrecognizable to those you would prefer not to know you, and your tattoos are invisible to those you would prefer not to see them and illegible to those you would prefer not to understand them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The origin of Man.</strong><br>
While performing hard labor you need no food, water, nor sleep. Once finished a work, you must &lsquo;catch up&rsquo; on all the food, water, and sleep you missed before working beyond normal human limits again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The source of Monkey.</strong><br>
With a word, you can cause everything in contact with your tattoos to fuse to them, holding themâ€”or youâ€”in place. It&rsquo;s probably anÂ <strong>INIT</strong>Â roll to use this to stop yourself from falling or something. Obviously you also need to have bare, tattooed skin in contact with the things you want to stick to. Don&rsquo;t do this when you already have a lot of momentum unless you want your Truths to separate from your body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The face of Aeshe (PBUH).</strong><br>
You have aÂ **1-in-6Â **chance per templateÂ to know one relevant piece of information about anyone you encounter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The location of the Second Moon.</strong><br>
Your tattoos itch when something is being concealed from you.Â If you would beÂ <strong>surprised,</strong>Â you&rsquo;re not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The nature of the Stars.</strong><br>
With a word, you can cause your tattoos to glow with the dim illumination of a starry night. This is sufficient to read by or keep track of your footing, but not increase your radius of vision in darkness. While active, invisible things within arm&rsquo;s reach are revealed to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The geography of the distant North.</strong><br>
You can read the current direction and distance to the well at the bottom of the world on the back of your left hand, and are protected as if byÂ <strong>clothing appropriate to the environment</strong>Â at all times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The creation of the Sun.</strong><br>
Your tattoos emit blasts of infrared light when struck. When something deals damage to you it catches fire forÂ <strong>1d6</strong>Â damage per round until extinguished. If you are reduced toÂ <strong>0 or lower HP,</strong>Â anyone looking in your direction mustÂ <strong>SAVE</strong>Â or be struck blind forÂ <strong>107</strong>Â minutes by an invisible sunburst.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="academic-implements">Academic Implements <a href="#academic-implements" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h3><ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Purple Mask.</strong>Â Depicts an old man, usually grinning. Allows you to see <strong>curse-fog</strong>Â and <em>maybe, sort of</em>Â <strong>angels,</strong>Â and marks you as a member of the Purple priesthood even though that&rsquo;s only about half-true.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Academic Robes.</strong>Â From a very fancy and reputable institution. Probably worth <strong>10Â gp</strong>Â if you can find a buyer that knows how much <em>you</em>Â paid for them. 1 slot unless you&rsquo;re wearing em.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Burglar&rsquo;s Clothing.</strong>Â Dark, close-fitting, has plenty of pockets that are perfectly sized for carrying books, writing implements, and thieves&rsquo; tools situated where they won&rsquo;t get in the way of movement. Covers <em>almost</em>Â your entire body, with just enough gaps that it&rsquo;s obvious you <em>have</em> tattoos but they can&rsquo;t be fully seen.Â 1 slot unless you&rsquo;re wearing em.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Soft Leather Boots and Gloves.</strong>Â Supple, comfortable, not all that warm.</p>
</li>

<p><strong>Tattoo Kit.</strong>Â A variety of needles, inks pressed from rare ingredients. Very efficiently packed.Â 1/3rd slot.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Holy Books.</strong>Â As the <a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html">Cleric&rsquo;s</a>.Â 1/3rd slot each.</p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Sharp Diamond Ring.</strong> Could cut glass.Â Worth a cool <strong>20 gp.</strong>Â Too small to take up space, really.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very Nice Perfume.</strong>Â An exotic combination of scents, very distinctive. Probably nobody you meet will everÂ have smelled it before, worth <strong>30 gp</strong>Â to discerning buyers.  1/3rd slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rifle.Â 2d8</strong> damage at a range of 60&rsquo;, -1 <strong>to-hit</strong> for every 20&rsquo; after that. Holds two rounds, takes two minutes to reload, and you must purchase the cartridges separately. 2 slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Musical Instrument.</strong>Â You pick which one. 1 slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hookah.</strong>Â Comes with enough scented tobacco for you to sit around smoking it like an asshole at least 10 times, even if you&rsquo;re sharing it with your friends. 2 slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fancy Cushion.</strong>Â An excellent seat. 1 slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Very Nice Hat.</strong>Â Your call if it&rsquo;s appropriate to the region (in case you need to blend in) or wildly inappropriate (in case you need to stand out).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Animal Messenger.</strong>Â A pigeon, perhaps, or an exceptionally well-trained squirrel or mustelid. Not a crow, raven, rook, or magpieâ€”those can&rsquo;t be trusted, they&rsquo;re too smart. 1<strong>HD,</strong>Â 1 slot if you&rsquo;re carrying it around.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Waterproof Matches.</strong>Â Will ignite and burn in any environment; wet, dry, or airless. Box of 20, 1/3rd slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An oddity. Roll <strong>1d6</strong>Â on the following table:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>WHITHER THE HEART,</strong>Â a <strong>medium</strong>Â rapier of bronte and chardun. Attracts or is attracted to iron. Sufficient to block ferrous weapons and projectiles if one spends their whole turn parrying, or always hits creatures that have blood and are not wearing ferrous armor. 1 slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Gleaming Stone.Warm to the touch, slowly shifts through the rainbow of colors, casts light like a torch. Priceless. 1/3rd slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Papers declaring youâ€”or at least someone who shares your name and descriptionâ€”a saint of the Purple orthodoxy. If read carefully, they also quite clearly imply that you are dead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bone knife with a long handle and a very small bladeâ€”more like a scalpel, really. Capable of cutting through anything physical, and some things not. Can be used as a <strong>light</strong>Â weapon that deals only <strong>1</strong> damageÂ but ignores armor or damage reduction, 1/3rd slot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A pair of round glasses with completely opaque lenses. Render lies visible and everything else invisible to the wearer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An enormous egg. Neither you nor anyone else knows what it contains. 1 slot.</p>
</li>
</ol>
