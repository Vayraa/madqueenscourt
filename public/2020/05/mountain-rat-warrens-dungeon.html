<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y287VjtbYqCNITL3RVib6CN8BoCoAQQl/view?usp=sharing">The Rat Warrens.</a> This is the &ldquo;western&rdquo; rat warrens on the map, under the New City, and is an &ldquo;introductory&rdquo; level to the megadungeon that is the Mountain. I&rsquo;m not going to pretend it&rsquo;s another Tomb of the Serpent Kings, but I think it does an okay job of teaching some basic dungeoncrawling lessons - carry lots of light, talk to everything, combat has consequences, it&rsquo;s okay to run from fights, et cetera.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s meant to be played with <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html">the GROG</a> and <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html">The Mountain at the End of the World Player&rsquo;s Handbook</a>, but (like any OSR-y D&amp;D-y thing) it can be adjusted with fairly little effort to pretty much any other system that you&rsquo;re familiar with. Of note I guess is that it doesn&rsquo;t include morale stats (I just use a Charisma roll) so maybe have morale be 7 +/- CHA mod (which gives ratmen 5 morale and feels appropriate) or assign it by fiat or something.</p>
<p>Adjusting it for a different setting is also pretty simple:<br>
hobgoblins = humans i guess, maybe elves or dwarves or what have you</p>
<p>ratmen, bat men = goblins, kobolds, or just leave them as-is<br>
elves (rooms 10-15 are ancient elf tombs but the assumption is none of the PCs know what the fuck is an elf, in case that wasn&rsquo;t clear) = ancient evil snake people or some other sinister long-dead empire</p>
<p>This dungeon is free (of course), but if anyone ends up playing it, I would certainly appreciate some feedback&ndash;or if you really enjoy it, a couple bucks thrown in my <a href="https://ko-fi.com/vayraa">ko-fi.</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty happy with &amp; proud of the Rat Warrens, and I hope to produce the rest of the Mountain levels in more or less this format over time. Let me know what you think!</p>
