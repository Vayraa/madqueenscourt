        <p><a href="https://oblidisideryptch.blogspot.com/">Oblidisideryptch</a>Â over on the OSR Discord is running a City Challenge. The rules are &ldquo;make an interesting city.&rdquo;, and I&rsquo;ve got two cities to flesh out, so I figured I&rsquo;d throw my hat in the ring.</p>
<p>References to money are silver standard. Rules are <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html">GROG.</a></p>
<h2 id="cities-on-the-mountain">Cities on the Mountain <a href="#cities-on-the-mountain" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>There are two &ldquo;Cities&rdquo; on the <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html">Mountain,</a> though &ldquo;City&rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer at least initially as at the start of the campaign they will be little more than shanty towns. The concept is that the cities level up as the players do, growing in utility and population and serving as a method of permanent, shared advancement in the face of almost certain PC death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to pull heavily fromÂ <a href="https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2020/01/it-takes-village-to-raise-adventuring.html">this concept</a>Â to run that, I think.</p>
<p>There are also a number of small farming/fishing/hunting/logging communities that support the Cities, generally close by and relying on them for protection. These each have a population under a few hundred and maybe one or two notable structures and ought to be the sort of thing that can be dropped in where appropriate and I&rsquo;m not going to detail them here.</p>
<p>If PCs advance one City, the other one will advance randomly - maybe at a lower (half) rate?</p>
<h2 id="the-new-city">The New City <a href="#the-new-city" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The first is the New City, originally constructed by settlers (the first on the Mountain) from the goblinoid Charter Nations some 30-ish years ago in a gold-rush frenzied dream of colonial riches as the first explorers returned to the Civilized Lands with tales of a green and pleasant land ripe for exploitation.</p>
<p>The second explorers, of course, didn&rsquo;t return at all. As a result, the New City has receded bit by bit within its initial bounds to the point where it is now more of a shanty town, set up within the half-finished ruins of an over-ambitious frontier wonderland.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s run more by the mafias and cartels of the Charter Nations than it is by anybody else, really. There&rsquo;s very little &lsquo;governmental&rsquo; presence, beyond a few ships in the harbor and a weakly organized militia.</p>
<p>TheÂ <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/05/mountain-rat-warrens-dungeon.html">Rat Warrens</a>Â connect to the City via a network of underground tunnels, and the Crabman Caves and Goatman Village are nearby. Ratmen are hostile but more of an annoyance than a direct threat, crabmen are largely neutral, and goatmen have a complicated relationship with the City (some neutral, some hostile).</p>
<p>Structures</p>
<p>Blacksmith and Bowyer (level 1)</p>
<p>Church (level 1)</p>
<p>Market (level 1)</p>
<p>Port (level 1)</p>
<p>Tavern (level 1)</p>
<p>Thieves&rsquo; Guild (level 1)</p>
<p>Walls (level 1, palisade)</p>
<p>Housing (population ~3000)</p>
<p>Ruins (easily repairable to house considerably <em>more</em>)</p>
<p>Demographics</p>
<p><strong>Species:</strong>Â Majority goblinoid, some orc/moth elf, few kobold/lizardfolk/minotaur/gnoll</p>
<p><strong>Class:</strong> Majority settler, some explorer/adventurer/criminal/mercantile, few militia</p>
<h2 id="the-old-city">The Old City <a href="#the-old-city" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The second is the Old City, a series of low stone blockhouses and massive ziggurats constructed innumerable centuries before by whatever originally dwelt on the Mountain, but colonized more recently (well within the last decade) by the orcish River Kingdoms. A nest of tents and lean-tos cover the tops, hosting the beginnings of a heavily industrialized, painstakingly cautious, and rigidly controlled colonial/extractive effort.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s much more well-organized than the New City, with most of the population belonging properly to one of the Kingdoms and working, more or less directly, for the colony.</p>
<p>Structures</p>
<p>Barracks (level 1)</p>
<p>Blacksmith (level 1)</p>
<p>Industry (level 1)</p>
<p>Market (level 1)</p>
<p>Port (level 1)</p>
<p>Towers (level 1, 2-story wooden towers atop ziggurats)</p>
<p>Workshop (level 1)</p>
<p>Housing (population ~1500)</p>
<p>Ziggurats (easily furnished to house considerably <em>more</em>)</p>
<p>Demographics</p>
<p><strong>Species:</strong>Â Majority orc, some goblinoid, few moth elf/lizardfolk/minotaur, no kobold/gnoll</p>
<p>**Class:Â **Majority worker, some military/settler, few explorer/adventurer/mercantile</p>
<h2 id="city-structures">City Structures <a href="#city-structures" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>You can advance a structure 1 level (or construct a new structure at level 1) by selling a significant treasure or spending a great deal of money in town. Every time a structure advances, the population of the City will also increase, as more people are drawn to the Mountain by the riches you recover. Past a certain point, NPC adventurers will also start venturing into the Mountain. Some structures might require additional conditions to advance.</p>
<p>A higher-level structure provides all of the lower-level services as well. When a structure mentions hirelings/special items/etc, reroll them whenever the party checks in at that location and have spent a few days or more outside of the City since the last time.</p>

<p><strong>Level 2</strong>Â - More complex trade goods (worked metal, furniture, fabric, &amp;c) are available in bulk. Produces, stocks, and sells minor vehicles (carts, wagons, barges, riverboats).</p>

<h2 id="hirelings"><strong>Hirelings</strong> <a href="#hirelings" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>You have two options for hirelings. Regardless of which one you use, hirelings haveÂ <strong>12 in one stat</strong> related to their profession or species and <strong>10 in all others</strong> or use their monster statline, if they have one.Â Doubling their wage adds 2 to theirÂ morale.</p>
<p><strong>Option One: Consistent Hirelings</strong></p>
<p>Hirelings have <strong>4 + CON HP per HD,</strong>Â haveÂ <strong>morale</strong>Â equal toÂ <strong>7 + hiring character&rsquo;s CHA,</strong> and demand a <strong>weekly wage</strong>Â of Â <strong>HD * 7 gp.</strong></p>
<p>This is probably a useful option if you&rsquo;re hiring a whole bunch of people.</p>
<p><strong>Option Two: Random Hirelings</strong></p>
<p>Hirelings roll each <strong>HD + CON</strong>Â for <strong>HP,</strong>Â have <strong>morale</strong>Â equal to <strong>2d6 + hiring character&rsquo;s CHA,</strong>Â and demand a <strong>weekly wage</strong>Â of <strong>HD * morale gp, +/- up to 50%****.</strong></p>
<p>This is more fun. Makes it a gamble. Especially if you don&rsquo;t tell your players the potential hireling&rsquo;s HD.</p>
