        <p>With apologies to Arnold K and Skerples; I have done a very ill-advised and possibly unholy thing.</p>
<p>I have grafted bits of <a href="https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm">D&amp;D 3.5 AKA the d20 system</a> (because that&rsquo;s what I grew up on and still informs a lot of my tastes) to the <a href="https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html">GL</a><a href="http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html">OG</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvTAQxdi0GP0QwheUiQbMDyMzwvWF8iM/view"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qtu9h7rOokg/Xobf59uUfXI/AAAAAAAAo7c/3mB7J9JnKScoL6GxNWUy5RJpH6jdVe1UQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/GROGlogo.png" alt=""></a><a href="https://draft.blogger.com/"></a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s called <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvTAQxdi0GP0QwheUiQbMDyMzwvWF8iM/view">the Goblin Ruins Of Gaming, or the GROG, and you can get it right here.</a></p>
<p>And shit, I guess you need a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5OhTRpLOhkT77ahIIt5CxjKaaMOkDFb/view?usp=sharing">Character Sheet. Here&rsquo;s that.</a></p>
<p>Notable features AKA &ldquo;what makes this different from every other GLOGhack or indeed OSR-adjacent ruleset&rdquo;</p>
<ul>
<li>Four base stats! Modifiers only! Basically point-buy!</li>
<li>Complex combat rules! Grappling rules!</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s only 8 pages including the cover!</li>
<li>The header font is called Goblin One!</li>
</ul>
<p>There&rsquo;s no content in here, but I was writing a whole game and setting as a d20hack and I think I&rsquo;ll shift it over to this because I like it better so expect bits of that soon.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Ironically, about seven minutes after I published this, Arnold <a href="https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/stat-squish-and-lawful-roll.html">posted</a> that he was abandoning roll-under for the GLOG in favor of only having modifiers. The d20hack I am abandoning only had modifiers (although it was a much more standard-for-d20 roll-to-beat-arbitrary-DC system). All things are thus in balance.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT EDIT</strong>**:**<br>
I&rsquo;ve updated the ruleset as of 2020-05-21, after running some playtesting.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT EDIT EDIT:</strong></p>
<p>Well, here we are, nearly a year later (2021-05-01) and I&rsquo;ve rewritten the whole damn thing to be a lot simpler. Gone are the novel dice mechanics and weapon tags, which feels like killing a part of me but it&rsquo;s a part that had to die. Also, oops, back to modifiers-only stats. Hah.</p>
