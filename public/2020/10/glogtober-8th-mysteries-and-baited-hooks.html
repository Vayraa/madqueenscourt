The Rangery ðŸ”—&lsquo;Ranger&rsquo; is an in-world title. Rangers are somewhat like a secret society, somewhat like a freelance intelligence agency. They exist in the largest cities and the most distant wastes; naturally, many of them have found their way to the Mountain.
All Rangers areÂ Made of Hooks, transformed into that shape through some arcane ritual initiation that has never been witnessed by an outsider." />

<h1 id="the-rangery">The Rangery <a href="#the-rangery" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><p>&lsquo;Ranger&rsquo; is an in-world title. Rangers are somewhat like a secret society, somewhat like a freelance intelligence agency. They exist in the largest cities and the most distant wastes; naturally, many of them have found their way to the <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html">Mountain</a>.</p>
<p>All Rangers areÂ <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html">Made of Hooks</a>, transformed into that shape through some arcane ritual initiation that has never been witnessed by an outsider. Perhaps there is an indoctrination component, some element of the process that turns double-agents into triple-agents and prevents them from betraying the Rangery. Or perhaps the ones that can&rsquo;t be turned are detected and quietly killed and replaced - after all, it would be hard to identify them once their body has been transformed into a knot of barbed and twisted iron.</p>
<p>Like <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html">Satans</a>, you should add Rangers to all your encounter tables, maybe opposite the Satan (boxcars?). They can appear anywhere. They shouldn&rsquo;t really be directly hostile unless you&rsquo;re _fuckingÂ _with them, so take reaction rolls on that end of the spectrum to mean that their purposes are orthogonal to yours and likely in conflict.</p>
<p>They make camps, small chambers of comfort deep in the underground or high on the face. They stock these camps with weapons and provisions, everything crafted solely from locally available materials. The entrances are very well-hidden, but should you find one uninhabited you are welcome to make use of everything within; if the Ranger had not wanted you to find it, you wouldn&rsquo;t have done so.</p>
<p>You can play aÂ <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html">Ranger Made of Hooks</a>Â if you meet a friendly one and accept and complete a quest**<em>mystery</em>** for it.</p>
