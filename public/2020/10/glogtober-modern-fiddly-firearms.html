<p><em>This is a refined, somewhatÂ <strong>simplified</strong>Â (yes) version of that, hopefully suitable for use in games that are not mine and are run by people who have a (very slightly) lower tolerance for ~firearm verisimilitude~. I__t&rsquo;s all the sort of complicated that you figure out when you pick up a gun, not every time you fire it, so it runs fairly smoothly in play if you&rsquo;re not swapping stuff around all the time&hellip; Still rather complicated, though.</em></p>
<p><em>Damage has been reduced a little from my original system (which was designed for d20 E6 with d8 HD) to be more appropriate for GLOG, but is still very lethal. Try not to get shot.</em></p>

<h2 id="armor">Armor <a href="#armor" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>This whole thing works better if you have armor give HP instead of AC. This lets you have dramatic moments where you get knocked on your ass when someone shoots you in the chest with a rifle, only to pull off your shattered plate carrier and return fire. You can still get AC from Dex, maybe Wis, and cover. My recommendation:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Light</strong>Â armor: A flak jacket, an undercover vest, other soft body armor, etc. Doesn&rsquo;t get in the way. <strong>5-10 HP.</strong>Â An unarmored vehicle counts as having this level of protection.</li>
<li><strong>Medium</strong> armor. A plate carrier with ballistic panels rated for intermediate cartridges. Quite heavy, encumbers like <strong>chain</strong>Â in your favorite medieval/early-modern RPG. <strong>15 HP.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Heavy</strong>Â armor. Hard body armor with NIJ Level IV protection, likely covering the shoulders, sides, and upper legs. Heavy and restrictive, encumbers like <strong>plate</strong>Â in a medieval/early-modern RPG. <strong>20 HP.</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s also vehicle armor:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Light Vehicle</strong>Â armor. On an APC, combat helicopter, or equivalent. You can&rsquo;t wear this, unless it&rsquo;s on an exoskeleton or something.</li>
<li><strong>Heavy Vehicle</strong>Â armor. Actual tank plating. You can&rsquo;t wear this, ever.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Personal armor</strong>Â is damaged before your HP, except by critical hits, weapons that say they penetrate its level of protection or better, and stuff that would ignore armor logically (falling damage, etc).</p>
<p><strong>Vehicle armor</strong>Â is the vehicle&rsquo;s entire HP, and can <strong>only</strong>Â be damaged by weapons that say they penetrate its level of protection or better, or critical hits.</p>
<p>More advanced, rarer materials might provide higher HP values or protect at higher levels. Improvised ones might provide less HP or encumber at higher levels.</p>
<h2 id="cartridges">Cartridges <a href="#cartridges" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The most important part of the firearm isn&rsquo;t actually the firearm, it&rsquo;s, uh, what it fires. This is what damage is based on. Cartridge stats have three values: <strong>Damage, Recoil,</strong> and <strong>Armor Penetration.</strong> I&rsquo;ll explain recoil when we talk about firearms themselves.</p>
<p>Also <strong>noise</strong> and <strong>range</strong>, I guess. Something with the &ldquo;quiet&rdquo; tag will be hard to notice from far away or pinpoint the direction of, especially if suppressed. Something with the &ldquo;loud&rdquo; or &ldquo;very loud&rdquo; tag probably can&rsquo;t be suppressed effectively.Â </p>
<p><strong>Range</strong> is dependent on class, potentially modified if you have a really long barrel or whatever. We&rsquo;ll get to that later. For now all you need to know is that you get <strong>-1 to hit</strong>Â for each range increment beyond the first:Â <strong>i.e.</strong> aÂ .22LR pistol gets -0 to hit within 30&rsquo;, -1 to hit within 60&rsquo;, and so on.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a list of some cold-war-era-to-modern stuff:</p>
<p><strong>Light Pistol - Range 30&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Light Pistol (.22 LR, .25, .32 or .380 ACP) - <strong>1d6</strong> - <strong>R0</strong> - quiet</p>
<p>Standard Pistol (9mm, .38 or .44 Special, .45 ACP, .40S&amp;W) - <strong>1d8</strong> - <strong>R1</strong> - quiet</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Pistol - Range 30&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>AP Pistol (HK 4.6mm, FN 5.7mm, 5.8mm DAP92, 7.62 Tokarev, sci-fi pistol) - <strong>1d8</strong> - <strong>R2</strong> - <strong>AP Light</strong></p>
<p>Magnum Pistol (.357 or .44 Magnum, 10mm Auto, .50AE) - <strong>2d6</strong> - <strong>R3</strong> - <strong>AP Light</strong> - loud</p>
<p>Fuckoff Pistol (.454 Casull, sci-fi bullshit) - <strong>3d6</strong> - <strong>R5</strong> - <strong>AP Medium</strong> - very loud</p>
<p><strong>Intermediate Rifle - Range 60&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Subsonic Rifle (9x39mm, .300 AAC) - <strong>1d10</strong> - <strong>R2</strong> - quiet</p>
<p>Intermediate Rifle (5.56 NATO/.223 Rem., 5.45 and 7.62x39mm, 5.8x42mm) - <strong>2d6</strong> - <strong>R2</strong> - <strong>AP Light</strong></p>
<p>High Power Intermediate (6.5mm Creedmoor, .50 Beowulf, sci-fi intermediate) - <strong>2d8</strong> - <strong>R3</strong> - <strong>AP Light</strong></p>
<p><strong>Full-Power Rifle - Range 90&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Full-Power Rifle (7.62 NATO/.308 Win., .303 British, 7.62x54R, .30-06) - <strong>3d6</strong> - <strong>R4</strong> - <strong>AP Medium</strong> - loud</p>
<p>Magnum Rifle (7mm Rem Mag, .338 Lap Mag, .300 Norma Mag, sci-fi rifle) - <strong>3d8</strong> - <strong>R5</strong> - <strong>AP Heavy</strong> - loud</p>
<p>Anti-Materiel Rifle (.408 CheyTac, .50 BMG, 12.7x108mm) - <strong>4d8</strong> - <strong>R7</strong> - <strong>AP Light Vehicle</strong> - very loud</p>
<p>Light Autocannon (14.5x114mm, 20mm, sci-fi AMR) - <strong>6d8</strong> - <strong>R8</strong> - <strong>AP Light Vehicle</strong> - very loud</p>
<p><strong>Shotgun - Range 30&rsquo;</strong></p>
<p>Light Shotgun (20 gauge) - <strong>1d8</strong> - <strong>R2</strong></p>
<p>Standard Shotgun (12 gauge) - <strong>3d8</strong>Â - <strong>R4</strong>Â - loud</p>
<h2 id="firearms">Firearms <a href="#firearms" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>The important parts of a firearm are its **Size, Ammo,Â **<strong>Action/Fire Modes,</strong>Â and <strong>Recoil.</strong></p>
<p>**SizeÂ **is pretty obvious. Can you fire it effectively with one hand or not. How many slots does it take up in your inventory. That sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Ammo</strong>Â is how many rounds it can hold. <strong>Reloading</strong>Â takes a <strong>move action</strong>Â (i.e. can be done in place of your movement <strong>or</strong>Â your action for the turn) **per round, clip, or magazine loaded.Â **If you&rsquo;re a <strong>Fighter</strong>Â maybe you can move and reload at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Actions</strong>determine what <strong>fire modes</strong>Â are available with a firearm and if it can be used for iterative attacks:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single-shot</strong> firearms have to be reloaded between each attack. Break-action shotguns and rifles are probably the most common form of this, but there are some single-shot bolt-action rifles as well.</li>
<li><strong>Manual (pump, lever, bolt, single, etc)-action</strong> firearms have to be manually cycled between each attack. It&rsquo;s assumed that you&rsquo;re doing this automatically as long as you have a free hand, but it means you can only make one attack with them per round even if you have multiple attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Semi-automatic</strong> firearms fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. You can use them to make as many attacks as you have in a round. If you&rsquo;re a <strong>Fighter,</strong>Â maybe you can also <strong>double tap</strong>Â to fire a 2-roundÂ <strong>burst</strong>Â with one.</li>
<li><strong>Fully automatic</strong>Â firearms fire continually while the trigger is held. You can probably only fire <strong>bursts</strong>Â and <strong>full-auto</strong>Â with them. If you&rsquo;re a <strong>Fighter,</strong>Â maybe you can also use them to fire single shots.</li>
<li><strong>Select-fire</strong>Â firearms can be used as if they were either <strong>semi-</strong>Â or <strong>fully automatic.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fire Modes</strong>Â modify <strong>recoil, damage,</strong>Â and potentially <strong>area of effect</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Single</strong>Â shots cost <strong>1</strong>Â ammo and don&rsquo;t modify recoil or damage at all.</li>
<li><strong>Burst</strong>Â fire costs <strong>3</strong> ammo,Â <strong>doubles</strong>Â recoil, and adds <strong>1 die</strong> of damage. A <strong>double-barreled</strong>Â firearm counts as firing a <strong>burst</strong>Â if you fire both barrels.</li>
<li><strong>Full-auto</strong>Â fire costs <strong>5</strong>Â ammo, <strong>trebles</strong>Â recoil, and either adds <strong>2</strong>Â <strong>dice</strong>Â of damage <strong>or</strong>Â hits everyone in a cone (roll the attack roll once, compare to all ACs or have them roll Dex vs your attack or whatever).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Recoil</strong>Â starts with the recoilÂ value of the cartridge, then is lowered by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ignore recoil</strong>Â if fired from a fixed mount on a vehicle or fortification or whatever.</li>
<li><strong>-4 recoil</strong>Â if set up on a bipod or fired from a prone position, etc.</li>
<li><strong>-2 recoil</strong>Â if the barrel is real long and/or heavy, like on a machine gun or full-length sniper or hunting rifle. This also doubles yourÂ <strong>range.</strong></li>
<li><strong>-2 recoil</strong>Â if it has a stock and you&rsquo;re using it.</li>
<li><strong>-1 recoil</strong>Â if you&rsquo;re holding it in two hands.</li>
<li><strong>-1 recoil</strong>Â per point of <strong>STR</strong>Â bonus.</li>
<li>Maybe it&rsquo;s got gyroscopic stabilization or a huge muzzle brake or something? You can figure out anything special beyond that.</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these apply <strong>after</strong>Â multiplying recoil for burst or full-auto fire. Whatever&rsquo;s left is a penalty to your attack roll.</p>
<h2 id="thats-fiddly-as-hell-fuck-you-vayra">That&rsquo;s fiddly as hell, fuck you Vayra <a href="#thats-fiddly-as-hell-fuck-you-vayra" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Yeah, it is, but you and your players only have to calculate this stuff once per gun. I recommend doing it in advance and building a table or generator or something. For example, here are some guns:</p>
<p><strong>Beretta 92FS.</strong>Â Semi-auto, 9x19mm Parabellum (1d8, R1/2, 30&rsquo;), 15 round magazine, 1/3rd slot.</p>
<p><strong>Colt Python.</strong> Semi-auto, .357 Magnum (2d6, R3/6, 30&rsquo;), 6 round cylinder, 1/3rd slot.</p>
<p><strong>Remington 1900 Sawn-Off.</strong>Â Break-action, 12 gauge (3d8, R1/5 in two hands or 4/8 in one, 30&rsquo;), double-barreled, 1 slot.</p>
<p><strong>PPSh-41.</strong>Â Full-auto, 7.62x25mm Tokarev (1d8, R0/1/3, AP Light, 30&rsquo;), 35 round magazine or 71 round drum, 1 slot.</p>
<p><strong>M4 Carbine.</strong> Select-fire, 5.56x45mm NATO (2d6, R0/1/3, AP Light, 60&rsquo;), 30 round magazine, 1 slot.</p>
<p><strong>Remington 700.</strong>Â Bolt-action, .308 Winchester (3d6, R0, AP Medium, 180&rsquo;), 5 round internal magazine (clip-loaded), 2 slots.<br>
<strong>Dragunov SVD.</strong>Â Semi-auto, 7.62x54mmR (3d6, R0/3, AP Medium, 180&rsquo;), 10 round magazine, 2 slots.</p>
<p><strong>FN FAL 50.63 PARA.</strong>Â Select-fire, 7.62x51mm NATO (3d6, R1/5/9, AP Medium, 90&rsquo;), 20 round magazine, 2 slots.</p>
<p><strong>Sako TRG-42.</strong>Â Bolt-action, .338 Lapua Magnum (3d8, R0, AP Heavy, 180&rsquo;), 5 round magazine, 2 slots.</p>
<p><strong>Mossberg 500.</strong>Â Pump-action, 12 gauge (3d8, R0, 30&rsquo;), 5 round tube, 2 slots.</p>
<p>Recoil values include stocks and stuff but don&rsquo;t assume two hands on a pistol, and are given for single/burst/auto where applicable. Slap that on a table somewhere for reference, and now you have it forever.Â </p>
<p>When someone picks up a gun, they write the name down in their inventory and figure out their attack bonus with it and they&rsquo;re good to go. Here&rsquo;s how I&rsquo;d write attacks with some of these down on my sheet for a <strong>2nd-level</strong>Â <strong>Fighter</strong>Â with <strong>+1 STR</strong> and <strong>+0 DEX:</strong></p>
<p><strong>9mm Beretta 92FS,</strong> +2 ranged (-1 per 30&rsquo;), 1d8 or double-tap (-1 if one-handed) for 2d8 and 2 ammo. 16/15 loaded, 15/15, 8/15 in spares, 83 loose rounds.</p>
<p><strong>7.62x25mm PPSh-41,</strong>Â +2 ranged (-1 per 30&rsquo;), 1d8 AP Light, 56/71 rounds loaded</p>
<p>Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â  **BurstÂ **+2 ranged (-1 per 30&rsquo;), 2d8 AP Light, 3 ammo</p>
<p>Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â  <strong>Full-auto</strong>Â +0 rangedÂ  (-1 per 30&rsquo;), 3d8 AP LightÂ <strong>or</strong>Â cone at single damage, 5 ammoÂ </p>
<p><strong>7.62x51mm FAL PARA,</strong> +2 ranged (-1 per 90&rsquo;), 3d6 AP Medium, 20/20 loaded, 10/20 in spares</p>
<p>Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â  <strong>Double-tap</strong>Â -2 ranged (-1 per 90&rsquo;), 4d6 AP Medium, 2 ammo</p>
<p>Â Â  Â Â Â  Â Â  Â  <strong>Full-auto</strong>Â -6 ranged (-1 per 90&rsquo;), 5d6 AP Medium <strong>or</strong>Â cone at single damage, 5 ammo, note to self: don&rsquo;t do this.</p>
<h2 id="a-guy-made-this-in-his-garage-while-on-pcp-and-tried-to-rob-a-train-with-it-and-got-shot-and-then-i-found-it-in-the-sand-twenty-years-later-is-it-still-safe-to-shoot">A guy made this in his garage while on PCP and tried to rob a train with it and got shot and then I found it in the sand twenty years later, is it still safe to shoot? <a href="#a-guy-made-this-in-his-garage-while-on-pcp-and-tried-to-rob-a-train-with-it-and-got-shot-and-then-i-found-it-in-the-sand-twenty-years-later-is-it-still-safe-to-shoot" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>Professionally made firearms that are frequently maintained have no chance of catastrophic failure. If you fumbleÂ your attack roll with one itÂ <strong>jams</strong>Â and will have to be <strong>reloaded.</strong></p>
<p>For everyone else, here&rsquo;s my post-apocalyptic quality table:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Professionally made</strong>Â firearms fumble onÂ <strong>1.</strong> Roll a <strong>d20:</strong> 1 breaks; 2-20 jams.</li>
<li><strong>Decent quality</strong>Â firearms fumble onÂ <strong>1-2.</strong>Â Roll a <strong>d20:</strong>Â 1 explodes; 2-10 breaks; 11-20 jams.</li>
<li><strong>Jury-rigged</strong>Â firearms fumble on <strong>1-3.</strong>Â Roll a <strong>d20:</strong> 1-5 explodes; 6-10 breaks; 11-20 jams.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Exploding</strong>Â firearms deal their regular single-shot damage to their wielder, with a <strong>DEX</strong>Â roll for half. <strong>Broken</strong>Â firearms can be repaired with gun parts and either an <strong>INT</strong>Â roll or a skilled armorer.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-melee-weapons">What about melee weapons? <a href="#what-about-melee-weapons" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>They should do more damage too, damnit.</p>
