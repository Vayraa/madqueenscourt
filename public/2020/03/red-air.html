<p>You can get it <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/110BKZlxkJQIFUqZoIQen_y9VTIR4jG2q/view">here</a> on Google Drive.</p>
<p>I have run exactly one abortive play-testing campaign using this game and it was fun as hell.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> If you&rsquo;ve come here looking for fun things to steal, it has:</p>
<ul>
<li>Communism!</li>
<li>A two-axis alignment system with mechanical effects!</li>
<li>Classes that auto-succeed at things as their only ability!</li>
<li>Vehicle rules!</li>
<li>A simple system for managing aerial dogfighting!</li>
<li>A system to create stats for pre-jet aircraft with just the input available from wikipedia!</li>
</ul>
