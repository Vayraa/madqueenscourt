&lt;p&gt;_&lt;br&gt;
The Road goes ever on and on_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Down from the door where it began.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now far ahead the Road has gone,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And I must follow, if I can,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pursuing it with eager feet,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Until it joins some larger way,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where many paths and errands meet.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;you-are-hobbits&#34;&gt;YOU ARE HOBBITS &lt;a href=&#34;#you-are-hobbits&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The passage seemed to go on for miles, and always the chill air flowed over them, rising as they went on to a bitter wind. The mountains seemed to be trying with their deadly breath to daunt them, to turn them back from the secrets of the high places, or to blow them away into the darkness behind.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xve72r7pS-xKqUWFVEHZ43jWwEo69cnv/view?usp=share_link&#34;&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a game you can play with one or more friends. If you plan to run it, you should read both pages. If you plan to play—but not run—it, you should only read the first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a silly little game that takes about two hours, maybe less. We do &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/08/canyon-one-page-solo-rpg.html&#34;&gt;silly little games&lt;/a&gt; here sometimes. I have playtested it once, which is good enough to convince me it&amp;rsquo;s fun. Ready for the prime time, on the blog circuit, bnaby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgM60pQ681vlmf7aJmTdT-YRCpDzQie5JHo7h0JqXcl3yOfXl2iHfP4Ohyg_DrJ1RP9cf58Z_MrCCYIFUaW4O8TBsWNWJ68rlb6PuJxtjrYB2p1qYO5y4reFafgvAgm19PZpcRoiqUYmeUo5v6TnaLkB9l1ylcExPYYceD6Qgf0GOXTITA-7xla41eCrA/s1920/FLvCdlbWQAU9dki.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgM60pQ681vlmf7aJmTdT-YRCpDzQie5JHo7h0JqXcl3yOfXl2iHfP4Ohyg_DrJ1RP9cf58Z_MrCCYIFUaW4O8TBsWNWJ68rlb6PuJxtjrYB2p1qYO5y4reFafgvAgm19PZpcRoiqUYmeUo5v6TnaLkB9l1ylcExPYYceD6Qgf0GOXTITA-7xla41eCrA/w640-h360/FLvCdlbWQAU9dki.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/EddieSharam/status/1494001517514436610/photo/1&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;gritty, poisoned streams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;===&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;trek-to-doom-mountain&#34;&gt;TREK TO DOOM MOUNTAIN &lt;a href=&#34;#trek-to-doom-mountain&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our intrepid two test hobbits, Snowdrop (Hobbit: 12; knife; boots; breakfast; cursed &lt;strong&gt;ring&lt;/strong&gt;) and Bigby (Hobbit: 7; sling; cloak; tobacco) set off towards Murdor with fresh water in their canteens and a song in their hearts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day saw them into the &lt;strong&gt;Razor Swamps&lt;/strong&gt;, their path ahead blocked by spurting &lt;strong&gt;fire geysers&lt;/strong&gt; as a gaggle of &lt;strong&gt;rich jerkass hobbits&lt;/strong&gt; tracked them from behind, certain they had stolen something of theirs. Thinking quickly, they smothered themselves in &lt;strong&gt;bacteria-ridden&lt;/strong&gt; muck from the swamp and dove through the fire, accepting some infection for safe passage. They drank nothing all day, keeping the good water filling their canteens in reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven hours journey the next day saw them come along a gritty, &lt;strong&gt;poisoned&lt;/strong&gt; stream, where &lt;strong&gt;dancing lights&lt;/strong&gt; enticed them to submerge themselves and swim. Snowdrop waded in cautiously to investigate and was grabbed by a slow-moving &lt;strong&gt;bog mummy&lt;/strong&gt;, but managed to distract it and pry herself free. Once they had made some distance, they drank their clean water and camped for the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A full eight hours travel on day three brought them to the &lt;strong&gt;Dark Gate&lt;/strong&gt;, a hulking fortification amidst the horrid mountains that ring Murdor. They began taking sporadic boltfire from the battlements while caught in no hobbit&amp;rsquo;s land, and suffered &lt;strong&gt;bacterial infection&lt;/strong&gt; in the scratches and glancing wounds they obtained while scrambling for cover, plus more as they were forced to drink from the murky pools in the mountain foothills that night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hobbits continued to make good time with seven hours march on day four, which brought them high into the greasy, dust-slick slopes before they began to hear hissing shrieks from the skies above—&lt;strong&gt;ringseekers&lt;/strong&gt;, mounted on horrible &lt;strong&gt;flying snakes&lt;/strong&gt;! Snowdrop used her &lt;strong&gt;good boots&lt;/strong&gt; to brace the pair on the slopes while Bigby covered both of them with his &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt;, and they waited there for the ringseekers to disperse. Camping for the night, Snowdrop collected some flint from the mountain so as to be able to make fire in the future—though they decided not to risk one that night in fear of the patrolling ringseekers, and instead drank cold, bacteria-ridden water from the murky pools on the mountainface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day five saw the hobbits high into the mountains, where they crested a peak and were unexpectedly tumbled into the snow-filled valley beyond by a rogue gust of wind. They dug themselves into a hollow and, finding overproof whiskey and dried bread among the provisions of Snowdrop&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;hearty breakfast&lt;/strong&gt;, burned those to keep warm. In this impromptu igloo they were approached by a &lt;strong&gt;ghostly dwarf-presence&lt;/strong&gt;, which Bigby immediately mollified by offering it some of his &lt;strong&gt;tobacco&lt;/strong&gt; before it was able to make any grim demands. As the snow was not specifically poisoned nor infected with bacteria, the two melted some with which to drink, clean their wounds, and refill their canteens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six hours on day six brought the hobbits to the numerous trapdoors and cave entrances which would let them into the &lt;strong&gt;Goblin Mines&lt;/strong&gt;, all of which seemed frighteningly rickety and decrepit. Bigby confirmed that some trapdoor-paths were frayed rope ladders, and pulled two up to braid one mostly-sturdy rope from them which they could descend safely. As the pair abseiled down into the tunnels they heard &lt;strong&gt;something huge&lt;/strong&gt; shuffling about below them, but Bigby slung a few stones down a side passage and whatever it was that they heard chased after the noise into the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On day seven the hobbits broke through into a lower layer of caverns—ancient dwarf tombs—when a distant rumbling shook the tunnel and broke several nearby urns, which began to emit a noxious poison fog. Bigby gathered the two under his &lt;strong&gt;waterproof cloak&lt;/strong&gt; while they ran, but it did not prove gasproof and both suffered &lt;strong&gt;heavy metal poisoning&lt;/strong&gt; from the fumes. Worse, their headlong rush drove them into a tunnel faced with the source of the rumbling they had heard: An enormous &lt;strong&gt;digging machine&lt;/strong&gt; which ate through the dirt towards them. Snowdrop attempted in vain to dig a hiding-burrow while Bigby cast about for some (famously flammable) &lt;strong&gt;goblin grog&lt;/strong&gt; and, finding some, set it aflame and hurled it into the behemoth&amp;rsquo;s grinding maw where it caught something internally and stopped the monster&amp;hellip;filling the tunnel with choking oilsmoke and further poisoning the hobbits as they ran. Later that day, stopped to rest, the pair risked a fire in the tunnels to boil some brackish water to drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five hours into the eighth day, the hobbits spied a group of orcish &lt;strong&gt;secret policemen&lt;/strong&gt; searching through the tunnels ahead. They took up some discarded goblin mining coveralls from a breakroom and attempted to sneak by, and while briefly halted in passing they managed to keep their cool and lie proficiently when asked if they&amp;rsquo;d seen any trace of hobbitses. Fleeing the encounter, a trick catwalk tilted down under them and threatened to slide them feetfirst into a &lt;strong&gt;goblin limb grinder&lt;/strong&gt;—Snowdrop, being further down, sacrificed her &lt;strong&gt;good boots&lt;/strong&gt; to save her hairy hobbit feet while Bigby, further up, was able to hurl bundles of nearby mining tools into the grinder to jam it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day nine, four hours in, Bigby led the way through a series of underground and mostly-abandoned records offices as the mines gave way to the barrack-warrens beneath the &lt;strong&gt;Training Grounds&lt;/strong&gt;. Opening a door with uncharacteristic caution, he luckily and hobbit-ly managed to prevent a makeshift &lt;strong&gt;noise alarm&lt;/strong&gt; from being sounded. A seemingly never-ending &lt;strong&gt;armored column&lt;/strong&gt; of orcish war machines trundled down a vast underground highway ahead, but the pair managed to cross by reusing their goblin disguises from earlier along with invoking the names of some orcish officers found in the records and reports of the offices they had just crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bigby continued to lead the way on day ten, six hours into which he blundered directly into the &lt;strong&gt;wrist-thick strands of a giant spiderweb&lt;/strong&gt; stretched across the tunnel, and Snowdrop became entangled as well when she tried to free him with her knife. The rough clatter of bone and metal heralded the arrival of &lt;strong&gt;burned-dead infantry&lt;/strong&gt; who proceeded to roughly cut the hobbits free, inflicting &lt;strong&gt;heavy metal poisoning&lt;/strong&gt; with nicks from their jagged, rusty blades. Bigby took advantage of this to break out of their grasp, but Snowdrop was further wounded by the **bacteria-laden **clawed fingers of the burned-dead as she failed to struggle free and had to be rescued by Bigby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eleventh day saw the hobbits finally back above-ground, winding their way through a network of mazelike trenches while the &lt;strong&gt;evil eye of g_d&lt;/strong&gt; searched for them with burning gaze. Fortunately a trench network is a fairly easy place to hide from such, and no special precautions were necessary. Snowdrop collected some handfuls of shrapnel for later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seven hours into day twelve, the two crossed a cratered and bone-dry wasteland under Bigby&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt; while a last, forlorn &lt;strong&gt;ringseeker&lt;/strong&gt; flew circles overhead in fruitless search. Both badly fatigued this late in the march, they failed to take proper care around the coils of concertina wire stretched through foxholes and barricades and suffered more &lt;strong&gt;poisoning&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After six hours of marching on the thirteenth day, the hobbits came to the foot of &lt;strong&gt;Doom Mountain&lt;/strong&gt;, and rested by a stream laden with &lt;strong&gt;metallic&lt;/strong&gt; sand (of which they drank deeply). While they were doing so, a piteous voice warned them of &amp;ldquo;great danger from the skies above&amp;rdquo; and bid them join it in a muck-filled dugout by the side of the water. Not trusting it, Snowdrop turned her face skyward and was instantly and permanently blinded when a &lt;strong&gt;column of burning golden light&lt;/strong&gt; scorched down from the heavens—Bigby managed to wrestle her into the stream to save her from being cooked alive, and chased off the piteous &lt;strong&gt;hobbit mutant&lt;/strong&gt; when it mocked them for not heeding it. He kept watch through the night to make sure the creature didn&amp;rsquo;t return, and was vindicated by continued signs of its presence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fourteenth day Bigby led the now-blind Snowdrop to a fractally sharp forest of obsidian spikes. He wrapped his &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt; around his arm for protection and smashed through the brittle glass with his canteen, which ruined the cloak but allowed him to escape with only lightly &lt;strong&gt;infected&lt;/strong&gt; scratches. The hobbit mutant awaited them on the other side, but they threatened it away, and Snowdrop stayed awake through the night to keep it at bay with hurled handfuls of shrapnel targeted by ear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the fifteenth day, very near the peak now, the two happened across something exceedingly unlikely: a small spring of cool, pure water issuing from the side of Doom Mountain. Not trusting it, they lured the hobbit mutant toward them by promising it the ring (it was desperate, and very stupid) and shoved it in. When no ill effects befell it, they chased it away again and rested and drank and bathed luxuriously until a lavaflow forced them to find higher ground, where Bigby again kept watch through the night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the sixteenth day the pair of hobbits reached the summit, the ring above the glowing, lava-filled caldera where the ring must be destroyed. The hobbit mutant charged them from behind in a last, futile ploy, but Bigby tripped it easily into the fire below. Inching out over the edge, Snowdrop produced the ring, paused&amp;hellip; and, failing her final &lt;strong&gt;hobbit&lt;/strong&gt; check, put it on. Fortunately Bigby was waiting for this moment and wrestled her down, and, knowing that he would never be able to dispose of the ring himself if &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; possessed it (due to the bacterial infection and heavy metal poisoning having by now entirely suppressed his already low hobbit-ness), he realized what must be done: He pushed the blind, screaming Snowdrop bodily into the pit, &lt;strong&gt;cursed ring&lt;/strong&gt; and all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;and-throw-the-cursed-ring-in-it&#34;&gt;(AND THROW THE CURSED RING IN IT) &lt;a href=&#34;#and-throw-the-cursed-ring-in-it&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that was that. Nobody actually started dying of bacterial infection nor heavy metal poisoning through the whole game, mostly due to luck, but they still provided a nice sense of urgency and did force a few hobbit-roll failures near the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The encounters got ahead of the hazards early and forced some interpretation to make them fit, but a two-page RPG was always going to require some interpretation anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you play this and have fun, let me know. If you play it and hate it, I meant for that to happen; fuck you, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&amp;ldquo;The brave things in the old tales and songs, Mr. Frodo; adventures, as I used to call them. I used to think that they were things the wonderful folk of the stories went out and looked for, because they wanted them, because they were exciting and life was a bit dull, a kind of sport, as you might say. But that&amp;rsquo;s not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually—their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn&amp;rsquo;t. And if they had, we shouldn&amp;rsquo;t know, because they&amp;rsquo;d have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on—and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end.&amp;rdquo; _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;**—Jolkien Rolkien Rolkien Tolkien, I assume **&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I go to the mountain side&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;of the house to cut saplings,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_and clear a view to snow on the mountain. But when I look up, _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;saw in hand, I see a nest clutched in&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the uppermost branches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t cut that one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t cut the others either.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suddenly, in every tree,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;an unseen nest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_where a mountain _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;would be&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;despite-the-best-efforts-of-my-biggest-haters&#34;&gt;Despite the Best Efforts of my Biggest Haters &lt;a href=&#34;#despite-the-best-efforts-of-my-biggest-haters&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am still alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, my real-life friends want me to run a LANCER game. There are several things about this that worry me. I will enumerate them:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I have not thought about Tabletop Role-Playing Games in any productive (as opposed to lazily, purely consumptive) manner in well over a year, and am massively intellectually unprepared for anything approaching a Creative Endeavour&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My friends have a high opinion of me and aren&amp;rsquo;t sandbox-B/X-brained OSR layabouts and thus expect some sort of detailed Setting and/or Story&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know shit about LANCER&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s okay. I have played at least one Video Game and I am going to Cheat, and Lie, and I will never be punished&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx8tSVEsiijU0ryJWvayAnDo4s2AjOChVr8z_cjtyxfqqJCx302I8kIKIvJPvFsJYrqGs81kNA5W2KAxWkSn1TFUL-MJMJ9s2rvCBxo3HIgHv2FROaNv-Rjj3HSpZrmUax52USPlI8qyp7MH_QMRI0wQKsg870cQZMPMFvCyV_HpXHMbmpEQcGYqGUzg/s6809/q6m3ni3st4s81.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgx8tSVEsiijU0ryJWvayAnDo4s2AjOChVr8z_cjtyxfqqJCx302I8kIKIvJPvFsJYrqGs81kNA5W2KAxWkSn1TFUL-MJMJ9s2rvCBxo3HIgHv2FROaNv-Rjj3HSpZrmUax52USPlI8qyp7MH_QMRI0wQKsg870cQZMPMFvCyV_HpXHMbmpEQcGYqGUzg/w612-h640/q6m3ni3st4s81.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a prayer for the body buried by the interstate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother of a soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tree in a forest up in flames&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black valley, peace beneath the city&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Where the women hear the washboard rhythm in their bosom when they say&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Give me good legs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And a Japanese car&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And show me a road&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the map for Elden Ring, the fifth—or seventh, depending on how you count &amp;rsquo;em—game in the critically acclaimed (I assume, I don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention to critics) Kings&amp;rsquo; Field series of Japanese Videogames, and the first one in it that I played or liked at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LANCER is a rules-heavy small-force cooperative skirmish wargame dressed up as (and grafted to a vestigial version of) a tabletop rpg, much-but-not-exactly like Dungeons and Dragons 4th Edition or Chainmail II, which is the same thing but exists only in my head, and somewhat less like but still similar to Pathfinder 2nd Edition, I think, at least in action economy and general visual layout, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I haven&amp;rsquo;t read it. I personally think it works quite well as one of those (rules-heavy small-force cooperative skirmish wargame) and rather terribly as a tabletop rpg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This works out pretty well when you intend to steal and pilfer and thieve from a from software action, rpg, because those spend a lot of time on Fights and a little on exploration and have some Sad, Giant Men and Weird ,Unhelpful Fuckers and OSR Aesthetics Of Ruin to spice things up along the way, a rhythm I think would lend itself well to LANCER. Perchance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, clever readers will note that the map has a big glowy thing in the middle. You know what else has a big glowy thing in the middle? That&amp;rsquo;s right. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/solar-system/sun/overview/#:~:text=The%20Sun%20is%20the%20only,tiny%20bits%20of%20space%20debris.&#34;&gt;Solar systems&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; And you know where LANCER is set? Yeah. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0062577/&#34;&gt;Space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s all coming together, baby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhX8o1AOW_9pG3iRdoUGGE6qIby_yLAMukQO7RlkDw6AfwHHejJRnFblQTYkWB1lrUXR12AWGPyP-0SJ2ETwA31QE5d7mUB5XjIbWVdK7tk40LXJQJDlmJMrQpVGaX31XNILozHd5OZOOCPcfLHQiyi4TLGRD6i2QngFNg-8Son11fb8-8pn0CKUDt29Q/s3405/LANCER%20souls.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhX8o1AOW_9pG3iRdoUGGE6qIby_yLAMukQO7RlkDw6AfwHHejJRnFblQTYkWB1lrUXR12AWGPyP-0SJ2ETwA31QE5d7mUB5XjIbWVdK7tk40LXJQJDlmJMrQpVGaX31XNILozHd5OZOOCPcfLHQiyi4TLGRD6i2QngFNg-8Son11fb8-8pn0CKUDt29Q/w612-h640/LANCER%20souls.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_There&amp;rsquo;s a forest on whose branches, &lt;br&gt;
__    Stretching forth like withered arms, &lt;br&gt;
__Clusters hang of fruit that blanches&lt;br&gt;
__    In the sun — but never warms.&lt;br&gt;
__&amp;lsquo;Neath the leaves are ravens tenting,&lt;br&gt;
__    Kites are hovering on the wing&lt;br&gt;
__Round-about, the harvest scenting,&lt;br&gt;
__    In the orchard of the King&lt;br&gt;
__Ye who love or pity cherish&lt;br&gt;
__    Come not near these laden boughs,&lt;br&gt;
__Here must hearts in terror perish&lt;br&gt;
__    Or to rebel thoughts arouse.&lt;br&gt;
__What&amp;rsquo;s this sound the wind is bringing?&lt;br&gt;
__    Do the foul birds dare sing?&lt;br&gt;
_&lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;Tis the croak of corpses swinging&lt;br&gt;
__    In the orchard of the King.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we can generate cute little planets with &lt;a href=&#34;https://troisjs.github.io/little-planet/&#34;&gt;a website&lt;/a&gt; as long as we time our use of the snipping tool correctly to get them in good lighting, and google image search &amp;ldquo;low poly sun&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low poly tree&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;low poly space station&amp;rdquo; and so on for the others, and put it all together in photo shop with a little violet prose. Assume these planets are star wars style: Lava Planet, Ice Planet, Lake Planet, Grass Planet, Cursed Poison Swamp Planet ,et cetera. One to four or so important locations each, five tops. Happily that also works out to how many the game&amp;rsquo;s got if you ignore minidungeons. I&amp;rsquo;m crushing Weeping Peninsula and Limgrave together because they look the same and the castle is the only interesting thing in Weeping Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re stealing the tone, too. This is a cursed system, long forgotten or abandoned, populated by withered husks in creaking hardsuits grown together with one another over long centuries, the Giant, Sad Men so bountiful in soulsgame population. Lots of tree-theme. Weird fucking merchants—actually, I think those are already LANCER canon. Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The players, I want to fuck with the tone of as little as possible, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to redact or correct anything present in the player book. With that in mind I suppose they&amp;rsquo;re regular Union lancers in service of the Administration, sent to make dangerous First Contact with this supposed ancient colony, and when they appear in a dark hole on Fascimile it&amp;rsquo;s a surprise; intercepted—killed instantly—by an anomalous blinkspace effect, probably related to the fact that there&amp;rsquo;s a giant space tree growing over the local gate. They wake up as subjectivity-overridden flash clone in some sort of pirate lab, ticking the box of soulsgame protagonists being undead and likely explaining some of the corruption undergone by the rest of the populace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stated &amp;lsquo;goal&amp;rsquo; of the campaign after that point is escape—or at the very least finding a way to get word back to headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I left the Elden Ring map in there at like 3% opacity, as a little treat. Little Eastere&amp;rsquo;d Egg. Private little joke just for me, that I can point to if and when my players figure out what I&amp;rsquo;m doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF7X1dfHpz4gDel8cFWffrgmc1e2Kb7MhGqTOO7sG3pjHmw4Iean_C_m31JoiESZDosfhvkcDSUgQx8UNqfdS3hoFL-O2nZ4z81DDytpGgeJwiNXwdf_eTwIbZ64tDcnRhzPBFD0likVRPHGQRlySpR0p6j24yNKihVio62ZA9-ijwdglq3Vb2fiSs6A/s1200/Armored-Core-IS-NOT-Mecha-Dark-Souls.webp&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhF7X1dfHpz4gDel8cFWffrgmc1e2Kb7MhGqTOO7sG3pjHmw4Iean_C_m31JoiESZDosfhvkcDSUgQx8UNqfdS3hoFL-O2nZ4z81DDytpGgeJwiNXwdf_eTwIbZ64tDcnRhzPBFD0likVRPHGQRlySpR0p6j24yNKihVio62ZA9-ijwdglq3Vb2fiSs6A/w640-h358/Armored-Core-IS-NOT-Mecha-Dark-Souls.webp&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What miracle is this? This giant tree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It stands ten thousand feet high&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;But doesn&amp;rsquo;t reach the ground. Still it stands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its roots must hold the sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know! Fuck! I do this in vain hope, I suppose, that this kindles the cold, dormant spark of Editing (not Creativity, that one&amp;rsquo;s all-the-way extinguished or maybe never existed in the first place) in ym Brain and I can finally think RPG thoughts agaibnm, &lt;strong&gt;g_d fucking willing&lt;/strong&gt;. In which case I guess there might be Posts in it, for you. Not necessarily related ones, just ones with a frequency greater than whatever the gap is between now and September of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, I might try to post play reports or mech stats for elden bosses or something, purely as a masturbatory exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our piss will fertilize next year’s zinnias as we rut atop decaying tomato vines. Eating out each puckered cavity, draining one another of all sweet salty goo. Ah, what a joy it is to recline with you in the sex forest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>To Truly Master the Art, You Must Be Prepared to Die for It (Class: Wizard, also Monk)</title>

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/09/to-truly-master-art-you-must-be.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt; A base class for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html&#34;&gt;BLACK STAR OF THE CANNIBAL KINGS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. This one draws heavily from &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html&#34;&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2021/08/seek-after-wizards-to-be-defiled-by.html&#34;&gt;wizards&lt;/a&gt; and also a &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/08/though-he-were-strong-as-seven-glog.html&#34;&gt;saint&lt;/a&gt; and at least one more (commercial) source which will, I imagine, rapidly become obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fzJamYOm7mo/YTAYal_4rYI/AAAAAAAAu0M/35r37MTnLKobGYRMHK0Ty82zQ2bwhcl3gCLcBGAsYHQ/s863/image-asset.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-fzJamYOm7mo/YTAYal_4rYI/AAAAAAAAu0M/35r37MTnLKobGYRMHK0Ty82zQ2bwhcl3gCLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h640/image-asset.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-artist&#34;&gt;Class: Artist &lt;a href=&#34;#class-artist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I consider the positions of &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and rulers as that of dust motes. I observe treasures of gold and gems as so many bricks and pebbles. I look upon the finest silken robes as tattered rags. I see myriad worlds of the universe as small seeds of fruit, and the greatest lake as a drop of oil on my foot. I perceive the teachings of the world to be the illusion of magicians. I discern the highest conception of emancipation as a golden brocade in a dream, and view the holy path of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-very-heart-and-substance-of-metal.html&#34;&gt;sacred alchemists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; as flowers appearing in one&amp;rsquo;s eyes. I see meditation as a pillar of a mountain, enlightenment as a nightmare in daytime. I look upon the judgment of right and wrong as the serpentine dance of a dragon, and the rise and fall of beliefs as but traces left by the four seasons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a Wizard, a practitioner of a Secret Art, one who seeks after the secrets of the cosmos—and has already learned more of them than is strictly good for a person. You have the same ability as the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-very-heart-and-substance-of-metal.html&#34;&gt;cleric&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; to perceive the spirit world, but spend your &lt;strong&gt;Magician Dice&lt;/strong&gt; to interact with it in a much more personal manner. You don&amp;rsquo;t get any _direct _bonuses to-hit or anything like that, but read &lt;strong&gt;The Self Remade&lt;/strong&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Esoteric History, Occultism, and one of &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Acrobatics &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Musicianship &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Alternative Medicine&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Two &lt;strong&gt;elaborate ornamental weapons&lt;/strong&gt; of your choice, one slot full of &lt;strong&gt;muscle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sinew&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;fat&lt;/strong&gt;, martial artist&amp;rsquo;s wrappings, simple robes, a pouch full of pre-fried flour, a canteen of water, one &lt;strong&gt;occult instrument&lt;/strong&gt; from the list at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; The Self Remade, Secret Art, 1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Dark Studies, Secret Tongue, +1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; The Art Realized, +1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Mastery of Life and Death, +1 MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;a href=&#34;https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2021/08/seek-after-wizards-to-be-defiled-by.html&#34;&gt;The Self Remade&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You may fill up to &lt;strong&gt;[templates]&lt;/strong&gt; inventory slots with &lt;strong&gt;muscle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sinew&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;fat&lt;/strong&gt;, through a day of focused effort (working out, stretching, eating a lot) per slot filled, emptied, or changed. Each slot of &lt;strong&gt;muscle&lt;/strong&gt; grants you &lt;strong&gt;+1 STR&lt;/strong&gt;, each slot of &lt;strong&gt;sinew&lt;/strong&gt; grants you &lt;strong&gt;+1 DEX&lt;/strong&gt;, and each slot of &lt;strong&gt;fat&lt;/strong&gt; grants you &lt;strong&gt;one point of damage reduction&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/08/though-he-were-strong-as-seven-glog.html&#34;&gt;Secret Art&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are almost a &lt;strong&gt;spellcaster&lt;/strong&gt;, having the ability to see and communicate with the spirit world and a pool of &lt;strong&gt;Magician Dice&lt;/strong&gt; which work very much like &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; generally do, except you know no &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;. Instead, you may decide before rolling to perform a feat of &lt;strong&gt;strength, agility, or endurance&lt;/strong&gt; to add any number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;, which exhaust just like they would when casting &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;. When using &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; in this way you may perform the feat with any part of your body; &lt;strong&gt;grappling&lt;/strong&gt; with your bare feet, lifting heavy objects with one finger, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may define and name your Art, which will grant you a &lt;strong&gt;benefit&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;drawback&lt;/strong&gt;. Here are some examples, but feel free to make up your own with the &lt;strong&gt;GM&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; assistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STITCH VEINS RED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Queen-in-red&lt;/strong&gt;. A careful style of barely-controlled momentum and frantic movement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You may expend &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; when touching a target to &lt;strong&gt;harm&lt;/strong&gt; (requiring a successful &lt;strong&gt;unarmed attack&lt;/strong&gt;) or &lt;strong&gt;heal&lt;/strong&gt; them by &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Failing to honor a &lt;strong&gt;promise&lt;/strong&gt; causes you to immediately roll all your &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; (exhausting them as usual) and suffer the &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; as damage - though this never causes &lt;strong&gt;serious wounds&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCELLENCE IS UNATTAINABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Judge Arbiter&lt;/strong&gt;. A languid style that appears as drunken swaying to the uninitiated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Those that interact directly with you treat all &lt;strong&gt;critical successes&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;fumbles&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You treat all &lt;strong&gt;critical successes&lt;/strong&gt; as regular rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POISON NEEDLE HEART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Witch-in-the-woods&lt;/strong&gt;. An elegant, defensive style which is beautiful to observe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Look into someone&amp;rsquo;s eyes and roll opposed &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt;. If you win, they obey a single not-obviously-suicidal command. If they win, they&amp;rsquo;re immune. You win ties.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: This is basically mind control and survivors will, once the command is discharged and they&amp;rsquo;ve had at least a day to think about it, be appropriately horrified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNDRED PACES LIGHTNING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Nomad Inquisitor&lt;/strong&gt;. An unassuming style with little grace but much power in its movements. Includes instruction in horse archery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Once per round on your turn, you may transport yourself up to &lt;strong&gt;100&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in a flash of white light without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You take &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; damage each time you do this, which is impossible to mitigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVERY TOWER FALLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Captain of Industry&lt;/strong&gt;. A precise style with few applications outside of violence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: When you enter a fight, choose &lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;violence&lt;/strong&gt;. If you choose &lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt;, you gain &lt;strong&gt;[templates]&lt;/strong&gt; points of damage reduction. If you choose &lt;strong&gt;violence&lt;/strong&gt;, your attacks &lt;strong&gt;ignore armor&lt;/strong&gt; and can, with effort, shatter stone.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: When you choose &lt;strong&gt;peace&lt;/strong&gt;, you become incapable of dealing direct damage. When you choose &lt;strong&gt;violence&lt;/strong&gt;, attacks against you always hit. These effects last until the end of the fight and you may not switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIX POINT AMPHORA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Madwoman Demagogue&lt;/strong&gt;. A flowing, artful style which exhausts its users quickly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You may edit your number of &lt;strong&gt;arms&lt;/strong&gt; with an hour of meditation. Your final number of &lt;strong&gt;limbs&lt;/strong&gt; may not exceed &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Each time you do this, take &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage. Walking around with a nonstandard body layout is considered freakish and undesirable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNCARING DEPTHS ENFOLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Eternal Crone&lt;/strong&gt;. An occult style whose practitioners appear to be in many places at once. _&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You may roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to order around creatures of the night (spiders, bats, black cats) and fish.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: This does not convey the ability to converse with or understand them. They&amp;rsquo;ll try their best to fulfill valid orders, but only have normal animal intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLUE FLAME HELLION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Firebrand Vanguard&lt;/strong&gt;. A vicious style incorporating powerful shouts and focused anger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: When you &lt;strong&gt;shout&lt;/strong&gt; while making an attack, your hands and/or weapon become wreathed in crackling blue flames, deal an additional &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage, and &lt;strong&gt;ignite&lt;/strong&gt; targets that fail a &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; check.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You take double damage from fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEN TON SKELETON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Tradesman Father&lt;/strong&gt;. A brutish style which absorbs blows and crashes through defenses.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You have &lt;strong&gt;+1 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per &lt;strong&gt;template&lt;/strong&gt; and cannot lose your footing or be moved against your will.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You weigh ten times as much as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWIN SOUL CHAINED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Revenant Spectre&lt;/strong&gt;. An arcane style which channels energy into the duplication of matter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You may manifest a twin self which acts separately from you, but may not range beyond &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; from your body.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Your twin shares your pool of &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; - any harm dealt to one of you is mirrored on the other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRACT UNCOMFORTABLE TOGETHER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Knight Myrmidon&lt;/strong&gt;. A defensive style heavy on feints and parries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Those you have not acted against cannot bring themselves to harm you directly.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: When wronged, roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; or swear an oath of vengeance. You must fulfill these oaths when able.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END THE LINEAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the sign of the &lt;strong&gt;Nobleman Gambler&lt;/strong&gt;. A style which shifts effortlessly between artful flourishes and sudden, deadly strikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You deal &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; damage to those in positions of power (mayors, officers, nobility) and &lt;strong&gt;quadruple&lt;/strong&gt; damage to Kings.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You &lt;strong&gt;fumble&lt;/strong&gt; on &lt;strong&gt;d20&lt;/strong&gt; rolls of &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; as well as &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KICK YOU APART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Associated with the darkness between &lt;strong&gt;constellations&lt;/strong&gt;. A grim, utilitarian style focused on lethality with no elegance or beauty to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Your feet are &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapons which deal an additional &lt;strong&gt;+[templates]&lt;/strong&gt; damage.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Your &lt;strong&gt;soul&lt;/strong&gt; is accursed, and will be dragged down to the &lt;strong&gt;underworld&lt;/strong&gt; by devils upon your death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html&#34;&gt;Dark Studies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have a &lt;strong&gt;[templates]-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance to understand ancient writings, witchcraft, curses, and other matters of mystic import immediately upon encountering them. If you fail, you may try again for the same matter upon gaining another template.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Secret Tongue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Choose something weird, like minerals, plants, water, beasts, or corpses. For deep metaphysical reasons, you may not choose birds. You may converse with things of that nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: The Art Realized&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are able to fully manifest your &lt;strong&gt;Art&lt;/strong&gt;, gaining her as a &lt;strong&gt;spell&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; exhaust only on a &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; when invested in her, and when using your &lt;strong&gt;Secret Art&lt;/strong&gt; ability she can be seen inhabiting your body and enhancing your movements. You may use your &lt;strong&gt;Art&lt;/strong&gt; to exert non-impacting force (push, lift, carry, throw, etc) on things within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw as if you were standing next to them, without spending &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The exact effects of your &lt;strong&gt;Art&lt;/strong&gt; when cast as a &lt;strong&gt;spell&lt;/strong&gt; depend on her name and nature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STITCH VEINS RED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Animates target corpse of &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 2&lt;/strong&gt; or fewer &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; that used to have blood, raising it as undead for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours under your control. If &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;3 or higher&lt;/strong&gt;, the effect is permanent. If &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;4 or higher&lt;/strong&gt;, the undead is sapient and not under your control, though it will be inclined towards gratefulness. Red ribbons extend several feet upward from major veins and arteries, driving it around like a puppet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXCELLENCE IS UNATTAINABLE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Tells you something the target is ashamed of, without alerting them. Higher &lt;strong&gt;[sums]&lt;/strong&gt; yield more cutting insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;POISON NEEDLE HEART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Plunges &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; golden needles into the target&amp;rsquo;s heart. Each time they act against you while needles remain, they roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; or take &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; damage as one is ripped out. They understand this perfectly, even if you share no methods of communication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HUNDRED PACES LIGHTNING&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Summons a &lt;strong&gt;horse&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;bow&lt;/strong&gt;, each made of actinic blue-white radiance. The &lt;strong&gt;horse&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;strong&gt;[dice] HD&lt;/strong&gt;, and the bow conveys a &lt;strong&gt;+[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus to hit and fires bolts of lightning which deal &lt;strong&gt;[dice]d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage. Each lasts &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EVERY TOWER FALLS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Topples target structure up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * [sum]&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in its largest dimension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SIX POINT AMPHORA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Pours forth &lt;strong&gt;[dice] ^ [sum]&lt;/strong&gt; gallons of water from your mouth. The water mirrors the composition of the last water you drank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UNCARING DEPTHS ENFOLD&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Submerges the targeted area &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in diameter (which must contain you) in a hadeal, lightless pocket dimension filled with cold, dark seawater for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours. You do not need to breathe while in this space, but others do. The portal appears, on the mortal plane, as a pool of the same diameter which accepts anything but light. Unwilling targets may roll &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid being sucked in when the spell is cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BLUE FLAME HELLION&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Transforms you into a &lt;strong&gt;giant ram-headed monkey demon&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. While the duration lasts, you are &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; stories tall and have &lt;strong&gt;[sum] STR&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; times your &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; additional &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;, which are lost first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TEN TON SKELETON&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A second skull erupts from yours and encases you. It extends &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * [sum]&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;radius&lt;/strong&gt; beyond your own body, has that much &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;, and is permanent until destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWIN SOUL CHAINED&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Chains the targeted soul (actual soul, ghost, spell, etc) to the targeted person or object for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, so long as each has &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; or fewer &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt;. Chaining a person&amp;rsquo;s soul to their body makes them immune to &lt;strong&gt;death&lt;/strong&gt;, provided their body is repaired before the duration runs out. Chaining a spell to something will often prevent it from taking effect at range. Further interactions will be adjudicated on the spot by your &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EXTRACT UNCOMFORTABLE TOGETHER&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Sets a table for you and up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; targets, and compels you to conduct a **tea party **for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds which can only be interrupted by &lt;strong&gt;damage&lt;/strong&gt;. If &lt;strong&gt;4+ MD&lt;/strong&gt; are invested, the effect is permanent until interrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;END THE LINEAGE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Permanently abolishes the target touched, erasing them from the present, past, and future and preventing them from rising as undead. Sapient targets may roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to suffer only partial effects. Works on progressively more powerful targets depending on &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Dead or dying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Unnamed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Of little specific metaphysical import.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;14&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KICK YOU APART&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Does not answer to her name, or any other. Her powers are therefore unknown.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point you are also capable of commanding other &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;, should you persuade one to follow you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Mastery of Life and Death&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are no longer bound to the eternal cycle, and are not affected by &lt;strong&gt;disease&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;age&lt;/strong&gt;. Unless killed, you will not die before your time. &lt;em&gt;Should&lt;/em&gt; you die, your next character may appear as a suspiciously similar sibling, clone, or reborn form and begins at the minimum &lt;strong&gt;experience point&lt;/strong&gt; value necessary to have the &lt;strong&gt;same level&lt;/strong&gt;, regardless of class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, you attract a &lt;strong&gt;student&lt;/strong&gt;, who you are expected to teach in the ways of the occult. They are a level &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Artist&lt;/strong&gt; of the same Art as yourself, played by the &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt;. Should they die, you will attract a new one within &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eXGBOY4S9S8/YTQNDcMbPEI/AAAAAAAAu3k/V8zPJV1-vQ4AGS6buUqDFYF7T3T_QXx7gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1400/0185901a5837a4a77696ea4151901d46.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eXGBOY4S9S8/YTQNDcMbPEI/AAAAAAAAu3k/V8zPJV1-vQ4AGS6buUqDFYF7T3T_QXx7gCLcBGAsYHQ/w462-h640/0185901a5837a4a77696ea4151901d46.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;occult-instruments&#34;&gt;Occult Instruments &lt;a href=&#34;#occult-instruments&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bladed Hat.&lt;/strong&gt; A stylish accessory and a deadly weapon. A &lt;strong&gt;medium (1d8)&lt;/strong&gt; weapon, 1 slot. If you start with this, you know how to throw it such that it&amp;rsquo;ll return to your hand except on a &lt;strong&gt;fumble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twin War Fans.&lt;/strong&gt; A pair of &lt;strong&gt;light (1d6)&lt;/strong&gt; folding blades designed after paper fans but made from high-quality steel, 1/3 slot each. If you start with these, you know how to throw them such that they&amp;rsquo;ll return to your hand except on a &lt;strong&gt;fumble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three-Line Rifle.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;heavy (2d8)&lt;/strong&gt; bolt-action rifle, decidedly anachronistic, can be fired once per round maximum. 2 slots for the rifle and another 1 slot for 10 cartridges, holds 5 rounds at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Four-Section Staff.&lt;/strong&gt; Some idiot chained two nunchucks together and now it&amp;rsquo;s your problem. A &lt;strong&gt;heavy (2d6)&lt;/strong&gt; weapon that folds for easy concealability or storage and takes up only 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blowgun.&lt;/strong&gt; Not one of those wussy little ones, this one&amp;rsquo;s about five feet of hollow bamboo and launches foot-long darts hard enough to lodge them in wood. A &lt;strong&gt;medium (1+STR)&lt;/strong&gt; ranged weapon. Comes with five darts, but you can make more with a knife, five minutes, and access to woodland. 1 slot for the pipe, the darts are negligible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Six-Foot Jian.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;massive (3d6)&lt;/strong&gt; bronze blade with tasseled ring pommel. 4 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broomhandle Mauser.&lt;/strong&gt; A **medium (1d8) **semi-automatic pistol, also decidedly anachronistic. 1 slot for the beeeg pistol with 10 rounds already in it, another 1 slot for another 10 cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighting Umbrella.&lt;/strong&gt; Metal fabric, reinforced ribs. A &lt;strong&gt;medium (1d8)&lt;/strong&gt; weapon that can be unfolded into a shield that grants &lt;strong&gt;cover (+4 AC and saves that make sense)&lt;/strong&gt; when held in two hands, but can&amp;rsquo;t be fought with in that configuration. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meteor Hammer.&lt;/strong&gt; Nine feet of sturdy cord or fine chain with a heavy mace-head at one end. A &lt;strong&gt;medium (1d8)&lt;/strong&gt; weapon that requires two hands but can strike at any distance out to &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. 1 slot. If you have another melee weapon with something to tie it to, you can, and wield both at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Ten Ring Broadsword. **Nine on the back of the blade, one on the pommel. A &lt;strong&gt;medium (1d8)&lt;/strong&gt; weapon. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Martial Artist&amp;rsquo;s Wrappings.&lt;/strong&gt; Tight bandage-like wrappings across the abdomen and chest, for compression and to keep everything in place. No slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Simple Robes.&lt;/strong&gt; Crude linen, undyed and untreated. A utilitarian garment. No slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-fried Flour.&lt;/strong&gt; A good way to keep it ready-to-eat, used as porridge when there&amp;rsquo;s water and fire available and eaten straight in emergencies. 3 rations, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canteen.&lt;/strong&gt; A bulky tin with a screw-on lid. Filled with good, clean water. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Horse.&lt;/strong&gt; Ill of temper, cloven of hoof, long and forked of tongue, fond of eating carrion, and refuses to be ridden. &lt;strong&gt;3 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, much too big to carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tarot Cards.&lt;/strong&gt; Nobody plays with these anymore, they don&amp;rsquo;t have enough suits. The &lt;strong&gt;magus&lt;/strong&gt; card is blank. Negligible weight/bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embalming Fluid.&lt;/strong&gt; 3 flasks, each enough to preserve the corpse of a horse or anything smaller. 1/3 slot each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Powder.&lt;/strong&gt; Unlimited use as long as you&amp;rsquo;re careful with it, comes in the color of your choice, turns flames that color. You could really freak the hell out of some peasants with this. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apprentice.&lt;/strong&gt; Currently in the form of a frog. They don&amp;rsquo;t listen too well (hence being a frog) but are literate and somewhat canny. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something Weird.&lt;/strong&gt; Roll &lt;strong&gt;1d6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talking Bust.&lt;/strong&gt; Your own likeness. Hates you, but hates everyone else even more. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wizard Blanket.&lt;/strong&gt; Manifests cutlery, plates, cups, a basket etc. when spread across the ground or a table. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t manifest any food or drink. Manifested items wither to ash when removed from the blanket. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death Incense.&lt;/strong&gt; Summons the most local ghost when burned, and allows communication with it. 10 doses. 1 slot total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Wooden Nickel.&lt;/strong&gt; Tails on both sides. Once ever, allows you to replace any die roll made by anyone with a &lt;strong&gt;natural 1&lt;/strong&gt; after the fact, at which point the coin disappears and passes on to a new owner. Negligible weight/bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPSETTING TO WITNESS&lt;/strong&gt;, name known instinctively. She is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 medium (1d8)&lt;/strong&gt; cut-and-thrust sword of ironwood, with sharkskin-bound hilt and elaborate guard. Summons a completely normal frog, toad, or regional equivalent (gecko?) when name is spoken. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Baby Clone.&lt;/strong&gt; One day, this&amp;rsquo;ll be a whole new you—but for now it mostly just poops and cries. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>The Very Heart and Substance of Metal (Class: Cleric)</title>

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/08/the-very-heart-and-substance-of-metal.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A base class for &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html&#34;&gt;BLACK STAR OF THE CANNIBAL KINGS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Gb2cC0cFZKQ/YSfWO4MRb6I/AAAAAAAAux0/oW9uieJ0odkgzDzdKZZuZ8vyLu59E91iACLcBGAsYHQ/s863/Minors%252BCups%252B02.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Gb2cC0cFZKQ/YSfWO4MRb6I/AAAAAAAAux0/oW9uieJ0odkgzDzdKZZuZ8vyLu59E91iACLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h640/Minors%252BCups%252B02.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two of Cups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-sacred-alchemist&#34;&gt;Class: Sacred Alchemist &lt;a href=&#34;#class-sacred-alchemist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guilt upon the conscience, like rust upon &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;, both defiles and consumes it, gnawing and creeping into it, as that does which at last eats out the very heart and substance of the metal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-Robert South&lt;/strong&gt;, a cleric by most definitions &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are a priest, a cleric, an &lt;strong&gt;adherent&lt;/strong&gt; to to the cult of one of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/what-noble-darkness-at-heart-of-man.html&#34;&gt;sacred metals&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of creation. You are blessed with the ability to perceive, communicate with, and command &lt;strong&gt;motes&lt;/strong&gt; (also known as **sprites **or &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt;) with &lt;strong&gt;Metal Dice&lt;/strong&gt;, a process that functions exactly identically to that for casting spells with **Magic Dice. **You don&amp;rsquo;t get any bonuses to-hit or anything like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Metalworking, Alchemy, and one of &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Natural Philosophy &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Logistics &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Oratory&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; As per adherence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Adherent, Alchemy, 1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Friend, +1 MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Panic Brewing, +1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Secretary, +1 MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Adherent&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are a member of a &lt;strong&gt;holy cult&lt;/strong&gt;, and people know you as such by the garb and tools you bear. You may rely on the good nature of Kings and Men to feed and house you in any populated settlement, and may call upon your &lt;strong&gt;order&lt;/strong&gt; for assistance when required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are also a &lt;strong&gt;spellcaster&lt;/strong&gt;. You begin with the service of the mote known as &lt;em&gt;Homunculus&lt;/em&gt;, and roll &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; on your cult&amp;rsquo;s list for an additional spell at each template including &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;. If you get a duplicate, choose the next one above or below it that you don&amp;rsquo;t already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A: Alchemy&lt;br&gt;
**When you come across a corpse, interesting plant, or other such thing you may spend &lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt; gathering a &lt;strong&gt;reagent&lt;/strong&gt; from it. In addition, for every &lt;strong&gt;watch&lt;/strong&gt; you spend traveling outside of civilization you may gather one random &lt;strong&gt;ingredient&lt;/strong&gt; from the following list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Eyebark&lt;/strong&gt;. Causes a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt;-related shift to the affected&amp;rsquo;s perceptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Ringleaf&lt;/strong&gt;. Physically manifests a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt;-related transformation in the affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Spaderoot&lt;/strong&gt;. Creates a **sample-**related vulnerability in the affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Clubseed&lt;/strong&gt;. Causes &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt;-related harm to the affected.&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Heartberry&lt;/strong&gt;. Heals or cures **sample-**related maladies in the affected.&lt;br&gt;
            &lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Diamondfruit&lt;/strong&gt;. Fortifies the affected against &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt;-related harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you &lt;strong&gt;rest&lt;/strong&gt;, you may combine one **reagent **with one &lt;strong&gt;ingredient&lt;/strong&gt; in order to create a potion, salve, oil, or other alchemical substance. Negotiate its effects with your &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt;, then note down the recipe for future use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you might combine an &lt;strong&gt;owl&amp;rsquo;s beak&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;heartberry&lt;/strong&gt; to create a potion which cures blindness (owls have good vision), or with &lt;strong&gt;spaderoot&lt;/strong&gt; to create a poison which causes those affected by it to become nightblind or gives them frail bones (owls have good nightvision and hollow bones), or with &lt;strong&gt;clubseed&lt;/strong&gt; to create a damaging poison which causes small scratches to appear all over their body (owls have sharp beaks and talons). If a numerical effect is needed, healing potions typically heal &lt;strong&gt;2d6 HP&lt;/strong&gt; and damaging poisons typically deal &lt;strong&gt;+1d6&lt;/strong&gt; if applied to a weapon, &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; if thrown, or &lt;strong&gt;4d6&lt;/strong&gt; if imbibed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you have significant (more than a day) downtime in a town or city, all your collected &lt;strong&gt;ingredients&lt;/strong&gt; go bad and you must restart your collection. The same does not apply to &lt;strong&gt;reagents&lt;/strong&gt; unless obviously vulnerable to spoilage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**B: **&lt;strong&gt;Friend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose one of your &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; to become a close &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;. When commanding them your &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; exhaust only on a **5 **or a &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt;, and they are usually willing to attempt tasks outside of their normal purpose (but within their capabilities) on your behalf. You may switch which of your &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; is your **friend **each time you level up, if you choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**C: Panic Brewing&lt;br&gt;
**You may perform your &lt;strong&gt;alchemy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt; apply/imbibe/etc the result in a single combat round, rather than over the course of a &lt;strong&gt;rest&lt;/strong&gt;. There is a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of it causing a random &lt;strong&gt;mishap&lt;/strong&gt; in addition to its normal effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Secretary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your name is known throughout your &lt;strong&gt;order&lt;/strong&gt; as a champion of your cause, and an acolyte or apprentice is sent to assist you. They are a level &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; Sacred Alchemist of the same adherence as yourself, played by the &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt;. Should they die, you will receive a replacement within &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; weeks along with a sternly worded letter of reprimand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Lead&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;em&gt;You are a member of the death cult of &lt;strong&gt;Lead&lt;/strong&gt;. It is your task to destroy Kung Fu. You are expected to remove magic from the world, by murder if necessary. You may travel with Wizards and Artists in order to hunt others of their kind, but it is your solemn duty to prevent them from escaping you at the last.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: Two flintlock pistols (1 slot each, &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; range), 10 pistol balls (1 slot), and powderhorn with 10 doses (1 slot), &lt;strong&gt;blue&lt;/strong&gt; robes, and a &lt;strong&gt;lead&lt;/strong&gt; teardrop pendant.&lt;br&gt;
Perk: &lt;strong&gt;Incoherent&lt;/strong&gt; undead will not attack you unless specifically directed, and you may roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to give them orders. You may roll opposed &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; (exhausting them as normal) in order to absorb &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; that directly target you.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Your soul is too heavy with Lead to properly bind to Gold - you gain no &lt;strong&gt;experience points&lt;/strong&gt; from treasure. &lt;strong&gt;Wizards&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will send their &lt;a href=&#34;https://glass-candles.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-guilty-will-not-judge-themselves.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;assassins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after you should you attract too much attention to yourself (or automatically at template &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t started happening by then).&lt;br&gt;
Spell List: &lt;em&gt;Homunculus&lt;/em&gt;, plus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ail&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Copper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You are a priest of the Good Church of Mother &lt;strong&gt;Copper&lt;/strong&gt;. It is your task to grant succor. You are expected to feed the hungry, tend the ill, shelter the homeless, and provide other aid when asked for or obviously required.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;copper&lt;/strong&gt;-bladed spear (2 slots, &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt;, reach), a &lt;strong&gt;red&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;green&lt;/strong&gt; woolen blanket which can be used as a robe, cloak, or bedroll, 3 rations (1 slot), a water canteen (1 slot), and a wine canteen (1 slot).&lt;br&gt;
Perk: Food and water multiply when prepared by your hands; you can feed up to &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; with a single ration, and vessels of water and wine you bear will never run dry so long as they are not spilled or drank from greedily.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You &lt;strong&gt;may not&lt;/strong&gt; refuse simple aid (i.e. that which you could grant immediately) to those who ask for it genuinely; doing so causes you to be &lt;strong&gt;doomed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Spell List: &lt;em&gt;Homunculus&lt;/em&gt;, plus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Radiate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Shield&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_You are an evangel of the &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; Church, which some call a cult. It is your task to spread the word of your Church and to save all human souls by destroying them. You are expected to argue theology, deface temples and shrines to other Powers, and desecrate corpses. But don&amp;rsquo;t take any of it too seriously - &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; always wins in the end.&lt;br&gt;
_Starting Equipment: A rifled musket (2 slots, &lt;strong&gt;2d8&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; range) with cruel bayonet (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;), 10 paper rifle cartridges (1 slot), &lt;strong&gt;ash-grey&lt;/strong&gt; robes including a mask or veil, and an &lt;strong&gt;iron&lt;/strong&gt; spike.&lt;br&gt;
Perk: You have &lt;strong&gt;+1 to-hit&lt;/strong&gt;. This bonus increases to &lt;strong&gt;+2&lt;/strong&gt; at template &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;. You may use &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; to destroy undead, as well as create them (it&amp;rsquo;s all in the wrist).&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: The corrupting influence of &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; has left you frail and sickly and scarred. You have &lt;strong&gt;-2 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per template, and the unprepared recoil when you drop your mask or veil.&lt;br&gt;
Spell List: &lt;em&gt;Homunculus&lt;/em&gt;, plus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Berserk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bolt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fabricate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locomote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Ruin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silver&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You are a confessor of the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Argent&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Order. It is your task to conduct human souls through the final stages of their journeys. You are expected to banish undead, investigate conflict, pronounce judgement, perform last rites, and (of course) take final confessions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A **medium **khopesh (1 slot, &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;), a polished breastplate (4 slots, &lt;strong&gt;4 AC&lt;/strong&gt;), &lt;strong&gt;black&lt;/strong&gt; robes, 3 vials of holy water (1 slot), and jingling &lt;strong&gt;silver&lt;/strong&gt; spurs.&lt;br&gt;
Perk: You can tell how long a corpse has been dead, how it died, and whether or not anyone has performed its last rites at a glance. Civilized folk are legally bound (though not always willing) to let you poke around in their business and abide by your judgements, sort of like if you had an &lt;strong&gt;FBI&lt;/strong&gt; badge in real life.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; tend to every dying person or corpse you encounter unless they have already had their last rites performed; failing to do so causes you to be &lt;strong&gt;doomed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Spell List: &lt;em&gt;Homunculus&lt;/em&gt;, plus:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bolt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mend&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Smoke&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You are a student of the &lt;strong&gt;Mercurial&lt;/strong&gt; Path. It is your task to reach nirvana, spiritual enlightenment. You are expected to take drugs, meditate, and respond to queries with smug mysticism or slapstick violence.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A short compound bow (1 slot, &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;), 10 arrows (1 slot), martial artist&amp;rsquo;s wrappings, a simple &lt;strong&gt;white&lt;/strong&gt; robe, 3 doses of opium (1 slot, narcotic), 3 doses of henbane (1 slot, stimulant), 3 doses of fly algaric (1 slot, deliriant), drug paraphenalia (pipe, tea set, etc, 1 slot total), and a small vial of &lt;strong&gt;mercury&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Perk: While meditating, you enter a state of &lt;strong&gt;suspended animation&lt;/strong&gt; during which you are approximately as aware of your surroundings as a sleeping person, require no food nor water, and are immune to environmental effects. Upon reaching template &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;, you also become immune to &lt;strong&gt;damage&lt;/strong&gt; while in this state.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: For each day you do not consume at least &lt;strong&gt;1 dose&lt;/strong&gt; of strong psychoactive substances, you take a cumulative &lt;strong&gt;-1 penalty&lt;/strong&gt; to all &lt;strong&gt;d20 rolls&lt;/strong&gt; until you get real high again.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Locomote&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smoke&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_Transmute&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;You are an initiate in the cult of &lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt;. It is your task to achieve power, of any kind, whatever the cost. You are expected to scheme, plot, seek out secret knowledge, serve dark powers and inevitably betray them, and amass wealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; mace with &lt;strong&gt;gilded&lt;/strong&gt; head (2 slots, &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt;), rich &lt;strong&gt;purple&lt;/strong&gt; robes, a fine mink or ermine cloak (1 slot), a &lt;strong&gt;golden&lt;/strong&gt; diadem or tiara, and a bottle of fine wine (1 slot).&lt;br&gt;
Perk: Your soul is porous and greedy like a sponge, binding easily to blood and &lt;strong&gt;gold&lt;/strong&gt;. You gain double &lt;strong&gt;experience points&lt;/strong&gt; from treasure and monsters.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You &lt;strong&gt;may not&lt;/strong&gt; willingly give up wealth, power, or proffer aid without compensation; doing so causes you to be &lt;strong&gt;doomed&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_Twist: The monkey is the Sacred Alchemist and the old guy is the spell. ;B)&lt;br&gt;
by _&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zbrushcentral.com/t/magician/206387&#34;&gt;RUIHENGLIU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motes-of-sacred-alchemy&#34;&gt;Motes of Sacred Alchemy &lt;a href=&#34;#motes-of-sacred-alchemy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where these spells refer to &lt;strong&gt;metal&lt;/strong&gt;, substitute the material of the Power you serve. These are, of course, merely the &lt;strong&gt;motes&lt;/strong&gt; you have immediate access to. Additional ones may be found in the wild and pressed into service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Homunculus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is a spindly mannekin constructed from the sacred metal of the cleric he serves. Homunculi (for unlike other &lt;strong&gt;motes&lt;/strong&gt;, these are markedly individual) tend to take on the prominent features of their masters—this one hunched and wizened, that one fond of wine and ostentatious dress&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Familiar (ho, oho) to all Sacred Alchemists, &lt;em&gt;Homunculus&lt;/em&gt; is a loyal companion and dedicated, if sometimes clumsy, helper. He may be called upon to exert up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; pounds of force on objects within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, and is easily bribed with &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; to perform assorted miscellaneous tasks. Notably, his personal connection to you makes him especially useful for negotiating—or enlisting—wild &lt;strong&gt;motes&lt;/strong&gt; into your service.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ail&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is sinister in appearance, hunchbacked and wrapped in the rags of a leper. She causes her effects with the raising of a withered hand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Renders up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice] HD&lt;/strong&gt; worth of targets within sight slow, frail, and sickly, halving their maximum &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; and limiting them to &lt;strong&gt;one action&lt;/strong&gt; per round. They may roll &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; in order to suffer only one of the effects (their choice) rather than both. &lt;em&gt;Ail&lt;/em&gt; lasts for a duration dependent on the number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Permanent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berserk&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is steel-skinned, wild-eyed, swollen with vein and muscle. Foam pours from her gnashing teeth and she moves with twitchy, erratic purpose.&lt;br&gt;
_Grants the target a &lt;strong&gt;+[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus to &lt;strong&gt;melee attack&lt;/strong&gt; rolls, a &lt;strong&gt;+[highest]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus to &lt;strong&gt;melee damage&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;-[lowest]&lt;/strong&gt; penalty to &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds. They must make all available melee attacks, but may attempt one &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; roll per round to end the effect early. You may command &lt;em&gt;Berserk&lt;/em&gt; without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bolt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is grim of countenance, armed and armored for war. Her eyes are tired, and her hands steady.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Fires &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; bolts of solid &lt;strong&gt;metal&lt;/strong&gt; which fly preternaturally fast and true on trails of sparks and acrid smoke. Each does damage equal to the the &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; of one &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; with no save or attack roll and can be allocated to the target of your choice. Can also be used for riveting, outside of combat applications.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Lead&lt;/strong&gt; bolts resemble: &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Bullets&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Snakes** 3.** Teardrops** 4.** Weights&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; bolts resemble: &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Railroad spikes &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Razor blades &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Framing nails &lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Industrial staples&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Silver&lt;/strong&gt; bolts resemble: &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Spears &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Arrows &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Dueling swords &lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Bladed crescents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is stern-featured and bears a small birdcage with a bell hung within. Metal straps are riveted across her face in a 2&amp;quot; square pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Encases a target that would fit within a &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; cube in a cage of flash-forged potmetal. The cage has &lt;strong&gt;[sum] HP&lt;/strong&gt;, ignores &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; damage from each attack or other instance, and is permanent until destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extract&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She wears a simple white shift, and has kind but piercing eyes. One hand holds a scalpel and the other a long pipette.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Extracts the named material from the touched target, and places it in a designated vessel if you desire. If used to extract something integral she deals &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage, &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; half, and requires a successful &lt;strong&gt;melee&lt;/strong&gt; attack to use on an unwilling target. If used to extract poison or drugs, it just works. Negotiate other use cases with your &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt; as they occur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabricate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is clad in leather apron, toolbelts, a large rucksack, all filled with tools and trinkets and conspiring to nearly obscure her entire form.&lt;br&gt;
_Creates up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; inventory slots worth of low-quality potmetal items or equipment, so fragile that each individual piece will break irreparably after one use. Alternately, creates &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; inventory slots of slightly-higher-quality objects, each sturdy enough to last until a &lt;strong&gt;fumble&lt;/strong&gt; is rolled and capable of holding moderate detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locomote&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is a jet-black, her massive head mounted on a roughly cylindrical body, her lower and rear parts disappearing in a maelstrom of churning levers and spinning wheels. She speaks in a piercing howl, accompanied by a deafening crescendo of pounding metal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Instantaneously transports up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; targets (including you, if desired) &lt;strong&gt;[sum] * 10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in a straight line. Everything in the path takes &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage, &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; half. If the transported would end up inside a solid object which was not destroyed by this damage, they take the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mend&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is sturdily built, wearing a simple apron and a leather cap. She carries a rod-and-serpent in her left hand and a hammer in her right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Restores [sum] + [dice] HP&lt;/strong&gt; to the target, whether organic or inorganic. Alternately, can be directed to solve specific problems dependent on the number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Fix superficial damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Mend broken bones, reconstitute detailed surfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Cure maladies such as disease and curses, mend complex details like artwork.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Reattach recently severed limbs, reconstitute ruined devices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Regrow missing limbs or organs, restore completely destroyed objects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;11&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is slender and completely hairless, clad in a loose, gauzy shift. Her skeleton is starkly visible through her skin and garment. She perceives the world in wavelengths impossible to us, and does not understand the fragility of humans.&lt;br&gt;
_Causes the targeted object within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw to radiate energy for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, of a type dependent on how many &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; were invested in her:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*   **1 MD** - Casts **bright** illumination out to **60&#39;**, warms like a hearth.
*   **2 MD** - Casts **bright** illumination within sight range, counts as **sunlight**, warms like a pyre.
*   **3 MD** - Casts invisible rays of **blinding heat**, deals **\[dice\]** damage per round within **60&#39;**, any who look at it within that range roll **STR** or are permanently blinded. Blocked by anything sufficiently opaque.
*   **4 MD** - Casts intangible rays of **poison fire**, deals **\[dice\] STR** damage per round within **30&#39;** to all targets, including **spells**, et cetera. Only blocked by lead or stone.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is crudely formed, as if pieced together from scrap clay by an inexpert sculptor. Over-fond of complex plans and mechanisms. Thinks she&amp;rsquo;s smarter than she is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Rots, shatters, withers, or otherwise destroys targeted objects within earshot, and is capable of wreaking an amount of destruction relative to the &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;*   **1 MD** - A few blows with a hammer (A handheld object, an artwork)
*   **2 MD** - Two folks with tools (A door, a chest, a sarcophagus)
*   **3 MD** - A half-dozen tradesfolk with block and tackle (A tunnel, a wooden building, an architectural feature)
*   **4 MD** - A dozen tradesfolk with heavy equipment (A stone building or fortification, a large cavern)
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;13&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is concealed under, or perhaps comprised of, ornamented plate with complex joints, and speaks of love and care with a hard edge in her voice. Her namesake is likewise decorated, a great disk bearing reliefs of heroism in intricate detail.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Defends you or a target of your choice within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, granting a &lt;strong&gt;+[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus to &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; and completely negating direct-damage &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is beatific in manner, wreathed in opaque clouds of solid white and black, clad in an unfamiliar work-uniform with militaristic detailing. Her eyes are closed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Creates a &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; radius cloud of opaque smoke which lasts for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, or &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes in strong wind. The effects of the smoke are otherwise dependent on the &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The smoke is sufficient to obscure details (faces, etc) and apply &lt;strong&gt;disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt; to ranged attacks made through it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The smoke is sufficient to obscure objects more than &lt;strong&gt;5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; away in their entirety.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The smoke is thick enough to conceal an outstretched hand, and completely opaque to supernatural vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The smoke deals &lt;strong&gt;[best]&lt;/strong&gt; damage to creatures other than you with every breath, and they must roll &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; each round or be struck permanently blind if it contacts their eyes directly. When commanded with this number of MD, _Smoke _instead answers to the name &lt;em&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Transmute&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is blindfolded, four-armed and resplendent with alchemical symbolism, bearing a tattoo of each element on the palm of one hand. She is crowned with a circlet of a material that cannot be described, which bears an empty socket above her brow where a gemstone would be set.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Transforms the touched target into &lt;em&gt;something else&lt;/em&gt;. Regardless of change, she cannot grant magical or supernatural abilities. If an inanimate object is transformed into something living, use fairytale logic—rocks are slow and grumbly, tools are helpful and pragmatic, &amp;amp;c.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;For reasons unknown to all, _Transmute_ refuses to work on any of the **sacred metals**. Legend holds that the **philosopher&#39;s stone** is key to unlocking the full extent of her power. Perhaps, in the meantime, a lesser stone might have some lesser effect?  
  
For each **MD** invested in her, choose to spend it on **difference** or **duration:**
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Difference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Same nature, different appearance (sword to different type of sword, human to different human, pine to other pine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Same size and type (sword to axe, human to chimpanzee, pine to spruce).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Change size OR type slightly (sword to shield or dagger, human to gorilla or baby human, pine to oak).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Similar size and type (sword to waterskin or wheelbarrow, human to dog or warhorse, pine to hawthorn).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Different size and type (sword to earring or sailing ship, human to dragon, pine to daisy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Different size and kingdom (sword to dragon, human to silver spoon, pine to human).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Duration&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;0 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OOt4aJObqCE/YSsOwt4U7ZI/AAAAAAAAuy0/k-l6UHpknUoSGqyVgYvCkBaaun62jbb-wCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/1_kcRvHGSTQnhATIHU1VP46Q.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OOt4aJObqCE/YSsOwt4U7ZI/AAAAAAAAuy0/k-l6UHpknUoSGqyVgYvCkBaaun62jbb-wCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h512/1_kcRvHGSTQnhATIHU1VP46Q.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetsuo: The Iron Man (1989)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;alchemical-complications&#34;&gt;Alchemical Complications &lt;a href=&#34;#alchemical-complications&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;mishaps&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mishaps&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#mishaps&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metal in your possession becomes uncomfortably hot, burning you for &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; damage per round until dropped or doffed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your muscles seize and air expels itself from your lungs in great hacking coughs, &lt;strong&gt;stunning&lt;/strong&gt; you for &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; rounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You catch fire, taking **1d6 **damage immediately and a further &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; per round until extinguished.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Metals in your possession become corrupted; &lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Lead&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Mercury&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Tar&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Silver&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Tin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Glass&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Copper&lt;/strong&gt; becomes &lt;strong&gt;Wood&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Lead&lt;/strong&gt; is unaffected.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become wreathed in a sickly glow, casting light as a &lt;strong&gt;candle&lt;/strong&gt; and causing &lt;strong&gt;undead&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dumb animals&lt;/strong&gt; to attack you on sight or flee (as appropriate) until the next time you &lt;strong&gt;rest&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You are stricken with a &lt;strong&gt;mutation&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; or it&amp;rsquo;s semi-permanent - the next time you get this result, lose it and roll &lt;strong&gt;N+1&lt;/strong&gt; new &lt;strong&gt;mutations&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dooms&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dooms&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#dooms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your surface turns to the Power you serve, granting you &lt;strong&gt;+2 AC&lt;/strong&gt;. The touch of your naked skin rots and corrodes metals, ruining them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your organs turn to the substance of your Power, granting you a further &lt;strong&gt;+2 AC&lt;/strong&gt; and rendering you immune to &lt;strong&gt;sleep&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;hunger&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;thirst&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;disease&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;having to breathe&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;aging&lt;/strong&gt;. Your touch rots and corrodes metal even through clothing or other protectants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your entire self turns to &lt;strong&gt;sacred metal&lt;/strong&gt;, body and soul. You become an inanimate statue (or puddle, if you serve &lt;strong&gt;Mercury&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;doom&lt;/strong&gt; may be avoided by finding the &lt;strong&gt;elixir of life&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;philosopher&amp;rsquo;s stone&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;panacea&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;universal solvent&lt;/strong&gt;, or other greatly sought-after Alchemical goal.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/08/what-noble-darkness-at-heart-of-man.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JoAHyw7Ydt8/YSQB2rfxx1I/AAAAAAAAuw4/GW7BAb8xaNIz22TxKTTNIh0pbram24uqgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/BLACK%2BSTAR.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JoAHyw7Ydt8/YSQB2rfxx1I/AAAAAAAAuw4/GW7BAb8xaNIz22TxKTTNIh0pbram24uqgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h640/BLACK%2BSTAR.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Titans&lt;/strong&gt; built the world by playing cards with a &lt;strong&gt;78-piece&lt;/strong&gt; deck. When their game was finished, they scattered them in the deep places of the earth and left.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the cards left on the surface sprang the &lt;strong&gt;people&lt;/strong&gt; we know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arcadians&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The civilized folk of the lush heartland, bronze-skinned and compact. Their suit is &lt;strong&gt;diamonds&lt;/strong&gt; and their metal &lt;strong&gt;gold&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re an Arcadian then you can identify &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/twenty-three-swords-ish.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;swords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other magical artefacts at a glance, and if your &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; is at least &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; then you can speak and read all human languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Yemics&lt;br&gt;
**            The educated folk of the southeast oases, grey-skinned and sharp-featured. Their suit is &lt;strong&gt;clubs&lt;/strong&gt; and their metal &lt;strong&gt;lead&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re a Yemic then you can &lt;strong&gt;fight like a caged animal&lt;/strong&gt; to make an extra melee attack at the cost of &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt;, and if your &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; is at least &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; then you can subsist indefinitely on strong tea and tobacco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**        Barbarians**&lt;br&gt;
            The savage folk of the northern tundra, ice-eyed and sturdy. Their suit is &lt;strong&gt;spades&lt;/strong&gt; and their metal &lt;strong&gt;iron&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re a barbarian then you have &lt;strong&gt;+1 to-hit&lt;/strong&gt;, and if your &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; is at least &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; then you&amp;rsquo;re immune to &lt;strong&gt;weather&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Monkeys&lt;br&gt;
**            The arboreal folk of the southwest jungle, naked and hirsute. Their suit is **hearts **and their metal &lt;strong&gt;copper&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re a monkey then you can hold things in your feet, do handstands, climb and jump real well and do all the other things a monkey is good at, and if your &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; is at least &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; then you know sign language—which will come in handy, because you can&amp;rsquo;t vocalize in human tongues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;Bonus monkey table&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
    STR    Monkey&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;+4&lt;/strong&gt;Gorilla&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;+2&lt;/strong&gt;Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Bonobo   &lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; Mandrill, Baboon, Gelada, Gibbon&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;+0&lt;/strong&gt; Howler, Proboscis, Colobus, Spider, Woolly&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt;  Macaque, Saki, Uakari, Langur, Douc&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt;Snub-nosed, Talapoin, Tamarin, Lemur, Capuchin&lt;br&gt;
                &lt;strong&gt;-3&lt;/strong&gt;Marmoset, Squirrel, Night, Tarsier&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Snake People&lt;br&gt;
**            The inscrutable folk of the southern wetlands, green-skinned and hairless. Their suit is &lt;strong&gt;eyes&lt;/strong&gt; and their metal &lt;strong&gt;mercury&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re a snake person then you are immune to &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt;, and if your &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; is at least &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; you can speak and understand the language of &lt;strong&gt;scaled things&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Horse People&lt;br&gt;
**            The nomadic folk of the northeast steppes, ruddy and lithe. Their suit is &lt;strong&gt;rings&lt;/strong&gt; and their metal &lt;strong&gt;silver&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re a horse person then you ignore &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt; penalties to-hit, and if your &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; is at least &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; then &lt;strong&gt;dumb animals&lt;/strong&gt; will treat you, personally, as a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Rock People who became Dwarfs&lt;br&gt;
**            The industrialized people of the mountains, originally from the northwest where there is now only ash, who have excised a part of themselves and become something less than human. They have no suit, and their metal is &lt;strong&gt;uranium&lt;/strong&gt; which is also called &lt;strong&gt;adamant&lt;/strong&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t think you can be a dwarf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nobody knows from whence came the &lt;strong&gt;Elfs&lt;/strong&gt; (powerful, individual, capricious) and the &lt;strong&gt;Leeches&lt;/strong&gt; (rain-slick, blind, hungry).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naFnupctNYw/YSQul_LL5ZI/AAAAAAAAuxA/GZuLPZ9q7jYa7y4bT9MnQGno37qlXKQrACLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/BLACK%2BSTAR%2Bsuits.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naFnupctNYw/YSQul_LL5ZI/AAAAAAAAuxA/GZuLPZ9q7jYa7y4bT9MnQGno37qlXKQrACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h640/BLACK%2BSTAR%2Bsuits.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;strong&gt;aces&lt;/strong&gt;, each placed on a mountaintop, were born the &lt;strong&gt;sacred metals&lt;/strong&gt; of earth:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Lead&lt;br&gt;
**            The basest metal, inert and dead. &lt;strong&gt;Lead&lt;/strong&gt; attracts and consumes magic, and can be used as a spiritual protectant or insulator. It is dull and heavy, a dark mirror of its brother &lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt;, and has few adherents but the dead. Those few it counts among the living wear blue, are expected to hunt Wizards, and wander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Copper&lt;br&gt;
**            The dog of metals, the mother of &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Copper&lt;/strong&gt; is helpful and easy to work. Pragmatic and simple and beautiful in her way, she is man&amp;rsquo;s best friend. Her adherents wear red and green, are expected to feed the hungry and shelter the poor, and are common in all territories of Man and Monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            A grim substance, &lt;strong&gt;Iron&lt;/strong&gt; severs the souls of those he contacts. He is a hateful thing, and means destruction, and those slain by him rise as &lt;strong&gt;undead&lt;/strong&gt; when exposed to moonlight. His adherents wear ash-grey, are expected to destroy icons and proselytize, and are common in the land of Yem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        **Silver&lt;br&gt;
**            The touch of &lt;strong&gt;Silver&lt;/strong&gt; burns away curses, disease, and other maladies, and is a toxin to the &lt;strong&gt;undead&lt;/strong&gt; and other monsters. She is known as the holiest of metals. Her adherents wear black, are expected to tend the dying and judge the guilty, and wander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;Mercury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bold and capricious, &lt;strong&gt;Quicksilver&lt;/strong&gt; is liquid at ambient pressure and temperature, and toxic to Monkeys and most species of Man. Their adherents—among the Snake People and &lt;strong&gt;Elfs&lt;/strong&gt; who can safely handle them—wear white, and are expected to use drugs and meditation to achieve higher states of being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;        &lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            The lord of metals, &lt;strong&gt;Gold&lt;/strong&gt; is most prized and studied among his kind. He is intimately connected to royalty, and accumulates spiritual weight when exposed to blood or violence. When possessed, he attaches to the soul of his bearer and adds his weight to theirs. His adherents wear purple, are expected to accumulate power at any cost, and can be found anywhere there is something to gain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lKVOJXEYAxM/YSRBQiF67FI/AAAAAAAAuxI/6sjiX9lOPq4Mi-7fyGRmDHwK7esa3ZQFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1100/image0.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lKVOJXEYAxM/YSRBQiF67FI/AAAAAAAAuxI/6sjiX9lOPq4Mi-7fyGRmDHwK7esa3ZQFwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h482/image0.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legend holds that the &lt;strong&gt;First King Prometheus&lt;/strong&gt; unearthed the &lt;strong&gt;King of Eyes&lt;/strong&gt; from its hiding place deep beneath the earth in ages long since past, thus bringing the curse of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html&#34;&gt;Kings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; upon Mankind. Legend also holds that he was devoured by his &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/steel-shod-and-nostrils-flaring-class.html&#34;&gt;knights&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; for this crime, and his bones interred in the distant northwest before it became a land of ash and folly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for the truth, well, perhaps there&amp;rsquo;s a hole you can die in attempting to figure it out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/08/steel-shod-and-nostrils-flaring-class.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I want to talk about lance charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--k54jBMnOXU/YRLzRzIf7YI/AAAAAAAAuiI/HlIlqVDbBaAoAJV8EdZ50bzcVQtUGjqagCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/joseph-qiu-norman-charge-4.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--k54jBMnOXU/YRLzRzIf7YI/AAAAAAAAuiI/HlIlqVDbBaAoAJV8EdZ50bzcVQtUGjqagCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h360/joseph-qiu-norman-charge-4.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vaguely medieval lance charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;em&gt;three point fifth edition of the World&amp;rsquo;s Most Popular Role-Playing Game&lt;/em&gt;, that being the one I grew up playing, a level 3ish fighter with a lance and a horse can do about &lt;strong&gt;48 to 207&lt;/strong&gt;—&lt;strong&gt;48 to 69&lt;/strong&gt; without a critical hit, &lt;strong&gt;nice #nice (nice)&lt;/strong&gt;—damage with a lance charge if you&amp;rsquo;re pretty strong and know what you&amp;rsquo;re doing, for example if you built your character to be Central European Minor Land-Holding Warrior Nobility Orc Cavalry Mulan. In a system where stuff of that level (including you) has &lt;strong&gt;20ish HP&lt;/strong&gt;, give or take.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I&amp;rsquo;m trying to say is, I&amp;rsquo;ve always felt like this is something that is missing from old-school play. I grew up with a very specific sort of mechanical fantasy simulation where lance charges essentially vaporize people, dragons, ogres, castle walls, &amp;amp;c, and &lt;em&gt;most systems I&amp;rsquo;ve played since then don&amp;rsquo;t deliver that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, obviously, a flaw to be corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQOqCpBlalk/YRL2SqZ-5TI/AAAAAAAAuig/FkuJ3nTV0psyP4CaGGWf9n7vv9gQhkx2QCLcBGAsYHQ/s990/Storm_Lances.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qQOqCpBlalk/YRL2SqZ-5TI/AAAAAAAAuig/FkuJ3nTV0psyP4CaGGWf9n7vv9gQhkx2QCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/Storm_Lances.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very Fantasy lance charge, of the type which we are discussing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;class-knight-as-superweapon&#34;&gt;Class: Knight-as-Superweapon &lt;a href=&#34;#class-knight-as-superweapon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a member of the Broadly Fantastical European Minor Land-Holding Warrior Nobility. You have been trained since birth in Athletics and Warfare and fed on a diet of blood and milk; but more importantly you are huge, and you will become even huger, and the hoofbeats of your steed shall echo both forward and back into myth and history, and you know how to &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html&#34;&gt;fight&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every template of Knight you have gives you &lt;strong&gt;+1 to-hit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Athletics, Etiquette, and one of &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Warfare** 2.** Heraldry&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Stewardship&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Three &lt;strong&gt;heavy lances&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;2 slots&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;2 hands&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo; reach&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1d10+STR&lt;/strong&gt;), a &lt;strong&gt;breastplate&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;4 slots&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;4 AC&lt;/strong&gt;), a &lt;strong&gt;destrier&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;4HD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;50&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; speed, for warfare and jousting), no food (shouldn&amp;rsquo;t you have a squire for that), one &lt;strong&gt;chivalric artifact&lt;/strong&gt; from the big list at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want a list of &lt;strong&gt;special&lt;/strong&gt; horses instead, there is a good one &lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/02/d100-horses-with-chris-mcdowell.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge, Mounted Combat&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Ride-By Attack&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Split Lance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Pierce The Heavens&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A: Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;br&gt;
**When you &lt;strong&gt;charge&lt;/strong&gt; at least &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;attack&lt;/strong&gt;, you get an additional &lt;strong&gt;+[templates] to-hit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;damage&lt;/strong&gt; and damage you deal is further multiplied by &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; plus the &lt;strong&gt;number of the following which are true&lt;/strong&gt; up to a maximum of &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; plus &lt;strong&gt;[templates]:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong&gt;mounted&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re wielding a &lt;strong&gt;lance&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve reached &lt;strong&gt;template D&lt;/strong&gt; in this class.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve issued a &lt;strong&gt;direct, personal challenge&lt;/strong&gt; to your target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Mounted Combat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When damage is dealt to you or your mount, you may split the damage received between it and yourself in any arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Ride-By Attack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you strike something with your &lt;strong&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;/strong&gt;, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to stop. You can keep going up to you (or your mount&amp;rsquo;s) full movement, and probably turn around to do it again next turn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Split Lance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By &lt;strong&gt;shattering your lance&lt;/strong&gt; as a part of a &lt;strong&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;/strong&gt;, you may reroll your &lt;strong&gt;attack roll&lt;/strong&gt; against adjacent targets in order to distribute attack damage in excess of your original target&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; among them. I envision this as an explosion caused in much the same way a gas-piston combusts fuel by compressing it but you can interpret it however you like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**D: Pierce The Heavens&lt;br&gt;
**Your &lt;strong&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;/strong&gt; trails swirling rainbow vortices, becoming charged with &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html&#34;&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and dealing damage to any target (including &lt;strong&gt;g_ds&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;) as if it were the most advantageous material or element applicable.&lt;br&gt;
Whenever you would be able to achieve a &lt;strong&gt;x5&lt;/strong&gt; multiplier with your &lt;strong&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;/strong&gt;, you (and your mount) may charge in any direction you can currently perceive in order to deliver it.&lt;br&gt;
Targets reduced to &lt;strong&gt;0 or fewer HP&lt;/strong&gt; by your &lt;strong&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;/strong&gt; disintegrate utterly, beyond the ability of any mortal magic to resurrect or make whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgwpeISmNto/YRL2DqbwG2I/AAAAAAAAuiY/VblllOHtVikVgKGOdKkcXMWgBEJKgf8JQCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/winged-hussar-hopia_JPG-800x547.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-GgwpeISmNto/YRL2DqbwG2I/AAAAAAAAuiY/VblllOHtVikVgKGOdKkcXMWgBEJKgf8JQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h438/winged-hussar-hopia_JPG-800x547.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;16th-18th century Hussarite lance charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chivalric-artifacts&#34;&gt;Chivalric Artifacts &lt;a href=&#34;#chivalric-artifacts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Need two hands to properly stabilize this bad boy, even from horseback. &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo; reach&lt;/strong&gt;, can&amp;rsquo;t be used against adjacent enemies. &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt; damage, 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breastplate.&lt;/strong&gt; Probably includes some shoulder and waist protection, too. You don&amp;rsquo;t carry a shield, so this is what your heraldry goes on. &lt;strong&gt;4 AC&lt;/strong&gt;, 4  slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Destrier.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; warhorse of the most expensive and prestigious sort. &lt;strong&gt;4 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;50&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; speed, well-trained in warfare and jousting tournaments, unafraid of cannon or ogre. Buying a new one of these is probably going to run you a cool &lt;strong&gt;50 gp&lt;/strong&gt; in a &lt;strong&gt;silver&lt;/strong&gt; standard game, and require you to be somewhere with a really nice stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Courser.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;medium&lt;/strong&gt; warhorse of the next-most expensive and prestigious sort. &lt;strong&gt;3 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; speed, well-trained in warfare and hunting, unafraid of rifle or boar. Buying one of these will run you about &lt;strong&gt;25 gp&lt;/strong&gt;, and require you to be somewhere with a proper stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rouncey.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; war-and-other-purposehorse of respectable quality. &lt;strong&gt;2 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; speed, well-trained in any purpose you could want it for. A rouncey is something like &lt;strong&gt;10 gp&lt;/strong&gt;, and the nicest horse at any given farm will probably count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mule.&lt;/strong&gt; Not, technically, a horse, though I guess you can ride it in a pinch. &lt;strong&gt;2 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;40&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; speed, well-trained in labor and fieldwork. Unafraid of heavy loads or dragging a plow, comes with &lt;strong&gt;saddlebags&lt;/strong&gt; filled with &lt;strong&gt;70 onions&lt;/strong&gt;. I bet you can get one of these for &lt;strong&gt;5 gp&lt;/strong&gt; in any thorp or hamlet worth the name, sans the onions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riding Basilisk.&lt;/strong&gt; Something like a six-legged Komodo dragon, only bigger and more colorful. The lizardmen of Sem ride these through the forests and plateaus of their kingdom, I think. &lt;strong&gt;4 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;40&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; speed, &lt;strong&gt;AC 16&lt;/strong&gt;, mesmerizing frills about its neck. Buying one of these would be tricky, anywhere else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shock Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Sacred tool of the Northern Paladins. As &lt;strong&gt;heavy lance&lt;/strong&gt; but can be triggered to project a bolt of lightning out the front for an &lt;strong&gt;extra 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; of reach &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; extra &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage, once only. Can be recharged in &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hour&lt;/strong&gt; with a proper electrical hookup or &lt;strong&gt;8 hours&lt;/strong&gt; rigged up to a waterwheel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Sacred tool of the Western Paladins. As &lt;strong&gt;heavy lance&lt;/strong&gt; but explodes for an extra &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage to everyone within &lt;strong&gt;5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; of the target (not including you, it&amp;rsquo;s 10&amp;rsquo; long), &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; half. One use only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Sacred tool of the Eastern Paladins. As &lt;strong&gt;heavy lance&lt;/strong&gt; but it&amp;rsquo;s also a decent &lt;strong&gt;handgonne&lt;/strong&gt;, dealing &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage with a &lt;strong&gt;20&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; range when used in that fashion. Can&amp;rsquo;t really do both at once since you have to choke up on it to light the fuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sun Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Sacred tool of the Southern Paladins. Can be triggered to go off like a flashbang, causing everyone nearby to roll &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; or be rendered &lt;strong&gt;blind&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deaf&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pocket Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Not a sacred tool, just a handy one. As &lt;strong&gt;heavy lance&lt;/strong&gt; but telescopes down to forearm-size, taking up only 1/3 slot when so compressed. Unfolds automatically when you press a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocket Lance.&lt;/strong&gt; Another handy tool. As &lt;strong&gt;heavy lance&lt;/strong&gt; but you can light the fuse and then hold on for dear life as it blasts you about &lt;strong&gt;200&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in a straight line. This counts as being mounted for your &lt;strong&gt;Knight&amp;rsquo;s Charge&lt;/strong&gt;, but you take &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage, &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; half at the end of your travel if you hit anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knight Light.&lt;/strong&gt; A sort of lantern designed to work just fine despite being swung around on the end of a lance or a charging warhorse. Dynamo-powered; doesn&amp;rsquo;t need fuel, just needs to be swung around on the end of a lance or a charging warhorse. 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plastic Tabard and Cape/Poncho Thing.&lt;/strong&gt; Traditional Knightly battle-garment, worn over the breastplate. Transparent, covers the whole body. Prevents you getting aerosolized dragon/footman/other knight on your clothes when you lance charge the aforementioned. No slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Plate Harness.&lt;/strong&gt; Proper, full-scale armor for tournaments and glorious battle. &lt;strong&gt;8 AC&lt;/strong&gt;, 8 slots, custom fitted, intricate scrollwork, massive codpiece, hideously expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Superlativesword.&lt;/strong&gt; A lance won&amp;rsquo;t always fit in the dungeon. This won&amp;rsquo;t either, but it&amp;rsquo;s the thought that counts. Eight feet long, with cruel parrying-spikes and an extended cruciform guard. A &lt;strong&gt;massive&lt;/strong&gt; weapon, &lt;strong&gt;2d10&lt;/strong&gt; damage, 4 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barding.&lt;/strong&gt; Armor for your horse. Gives it &lt;strong&gt;AC 16&lt;/strong&gt;. Pretty important for keeping it alive. 12 slots if you have to carry it around, effectively none for your horse (horse inventory works on a different scale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Squire.&lt;/strong&gt; A youth, aged &lt;strong&gt;1d6+8&lt;/strong&gt;. Feeds your horses, polishes your breastplate, carries spare lances around. Really quite useful. Would no doubt like to be a Knight themself someday. 10 slots, but you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have to carry them much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something &lt;strong&gt;weird.&lt;/strong&gt; Roll &lt;strong&gt;1d6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cursed teaset. Appears full and pleasantly hot at all times. Is completely empty at all times, even if filled. If disposed of, reappears in your bag at dinnertime. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perfectly reflective gorget. Blinds in sunlight, redirects arrows, bullets, laser beams to random targets, the works. &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance for it to be hit whenever you would be. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Penetrating lance oil. Allows a weapon to hurt &lt;strong&gt;g_ds&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;spells.&lt;/strong&gt; Works on non-lances too, if you&amp;rsquo;re okay with &lt;em&gt;using it wrong&lt;/em&gt;. 10 doses, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lance quiver. Something like a beeg golf bag. 3 slots, holds like, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, 10 slots worth of &lt;strong&gt;heavy lances&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;superlativeswords&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;THINGS USED TO BE BUILT TO LAST&lt;/strong&gt;. Sort of a poll-chainsaw—a chainsaw lance, if you will. As &lt;strong&gt;heavy lance&lt;/strong&gt; but deals an extra &lt;strong&gt;1d10 exploding&lt;/strong&gt; damage whenever fueled up, can be refueled with any liquid even though you&amp;rsquo;re not a proper &lt;a href=&#34;https://modronrpgs.blogspot.com/2021/08/you-exude-cosmic-darkness-glog-class.html&#34;&gt;Chainsaw Wizard&lt;/a&gt;, and screams like a cat made of knives caught in a garbage disposal. Perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s lucky you don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wizard&lt;/em&gt; squire. A doofy sort of sorcerer like one in a storybook for children, aged &lt;strong&gt;2d20+60&lt;/strong&gt;, uncomfortably sleepy and criminally forgetful. Knows &lt;em&gt;Polish Armor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Summon Lance&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Whoops!&lt;/em&gt;. Has &lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; and wears a &lt;strong&gt;wizard robe&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Classic illustration-ish lance charge from a clip art website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-is-this-interesting&#34;&gt;Why Is This Interesting? &lt;a href=&#34;#why-is-this-interesting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s an extension of the theory of a &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2021/03/how-could-i-of-all-people-fall-silent.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Fighter as the member of an expeditionary force of specialists, who specializes in Fighting as opposed to Medicine or Dinosaur Psychology&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;. This class is a hyperspecialized version of that idea; a Fighter who is not only capable of Fighting anything they meet, but probably &lt;em&gt;trivializing&lt;/em&gt; it, as long as they have their horse with them, and enough room to wield a lance, and at least 20&amp;rsquo; to maneuver (have to charge at least 10&amp;rsquo;, and the lance is 10&amp;rsquo; long). They have some ability if not all those things are true, but ultimately what it comes down to is that if your DM lets you line up on someone with your mount, your lance, and 20 clear feet between you they know &lt;em&gt;exactly&lt;/em&gt; what they&amp;rsquo;re doing and it oughtn&amp;rsquo;t be that disruptive for you to vaporize them with your lance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Properly, I suppose that means that their party should be comprised of other hyperspecialist classes. Dinosaur Psychologist indeed. I guess that was what 3.5e did, in the end, with the miles of supplemental books and the involved character builds - though most of it was, as this is, focused around combat. Very specifically, very specific ways to win fights. Hmm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Knight-as-Superweapon is a very powerful tool (lance charges) with very specific applications (trolls, drawbridges, fortress walls, other knights, dragons, et cetera). I think it&amp;rsquo;s, paradoxically, probably most interesting in a game where you don&amp;rsquo;t fight all that much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another thing I like about it is that it&amp;rsquo;s not reliant on a magic horse or magic lances. Your horse is a real horse, with all the attendant not-wanting-to-go-in-a-dungeon-or-being-able-to-climb-ladders that that entails, and your lances shatter. You need to bring horses and lances around. That&amp;rsquo;s cool, to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also think it implies something very funny about the setting. This is a world that will never invent the tank, probably, because why would you when a guy can sneak up on it with twelve feet of wood and a quick little horse and lance charge it into next Tuesday. Knights-as-Superweapons indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;S&amp;rsquo;also a power fantasy, of course. I dunno, I think that&amp;rsquo;s kind of fun. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have a few more lance charge pics that I didn&amp;rsquo;t fit in yet, here they are. As you can see, lance charges have been used throughout history, and will be used throughout the future as well:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Civil War lance charge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know not with what weapons World War II was fought, but World War III will be fought with lance and steed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ggBGHb9Eusk/YRL2Z8aKd8I/AAAAAAAAuis/TkcXT0SVBK8J1k3OZLSm06nFFvmg_7uNACLcBGAsYHQ/s930/Attilan_Cav_Charge.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ggBGHb9Eusk/YRL2Z8aKd8I/AAAAAAAAuis/TkcXT0SVBK8J1k3OZLSm06nFFvmg_7uNACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h576/Attilan_Cav_Charge.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lance charge in the 41st millenium, in the grim darkness of which there is only war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EEMLcedQHfg/YRL2Z5s1vpI/AAAAAAAAuiw/6zsb1KtBm78sj8t60mPJ3hjn6aICZQLSACLcBGAsYHQ/s1280/lance_charge_by_neo_castilian35_de92uh4-fullview.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EEMLcedQHfg/YRL2Z5s1vpI/AAAAAAAAuiw/6zsb1KtBm78sj8t60mPJ3hjn6aICZQLSACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h482/lance_charge_by_neo_castilian35_de92uh4-fullview.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;lance charge. lance charge. lance charge. lance charge is the fastest, it is faster than anything. it is faster than light, it is more than we can comprehend. it is a beam of pure thought directed from my shoulder into your solar plexus at a billion miles a second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_i lance charged someone today and when the smoke cleared we were both 10 years younger. he tried to feint me but before his brain could even send the impulse to the nerves in his body telling him to point over my shoulder, i had lance charged him twice. sometimes i do it so quickly i don&amp;rsquo;t even know it happened, i am just instantly surrounded by mountains of bodies, shields splintered and chests crushed like old fruit. _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i have tested this, i have tested it in my cum fort. it is hopeless. i send this message from the distant future, lance charges have trapped me in the time and space i do not recognize. send help. lance charge a trauma kit and it may end up near my epoch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BLACK STAR OF THE CANNIBAL KINGS (Setting, Setting Element)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Aug 2021 14:15:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;About fifteen months ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://whimsicalmountain.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Gorinch&lt;/a&gt; put forward an interesting idea and there was some discussion of Kings. What separates them from dwarfs and elfs and Man. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--Co9sQCdfq0/YRLDPi2oQjI/AAAAAAAAuhM/mQYTnIqeB-QALcP6aivmsFglKQFcWfEDwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--Co9sQCdfq0/YRLDPi2oQjI/AAAAAAAAuhM/mQYTnIqeB-QALcP6aivmsFglKQFcWfEDwCLcBGAsYHQ/w580-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good to be the King.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-defines-a-king&#34;&gt;What Defines A King? &lt;a href=&#34;#what-defines-a-king&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Size.&lt;/strong&gt; They get bigger as they eat, and live, and grow. Petty Kings, of the sort that abound these days, are about twice as tall as a man. The High King, who has lived for a century and a half, is as tall as a tower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mindset.&lt;/strong&gt; Kings are inhuman, hungering, imperious things. They do not think, nor feel, nor act like a people. The King demands pearls! Cattle! Riches! Dancing girls! Dancing boys! Dancing bears! Whales! Forests! Industry! Knights come and carry off your granaries and if they&amp;rsquo;re not full enough then oh well, mark off your least favorite sun or daughter. The King needs to eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diet.&lt;/strong&gt; Kings eat one another and common folk too. They can restrain themselves from the latter if well-satiated with meat and grain, but if you put two Kings of approximately similar size in the same Kingdom one of them is going to kill and eat the other one. It&amp;rsquo;s just a law of nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power.&lt;/strong&gt; Besides being at least as big as a house and twice as sturdy, the word of a King is law. They possess the ability to issue Commands, which must be obeyed by those within their Domain and are difficult to resist even for those without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kings of appropriately distinct sizes can form hierarchies, which is how the High King rules the petty Kings of the land and why they haven&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; killed and eaten each other yet (they still get up to plenty of it, but less than they would without a High King in place). Obviously, he must consume any that grow large enough to threaten him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s fallen age this is about as big as Kings can get, but the histories tell of Grand Kings the size of cities. And in ages long past there was held to be an Emperor, the First King, who if he truly lived must have been the size of a mountain range&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SQU6puJ8Tgs/YRLHUbQdP3I/AAAAAAAAuhU/b37ZZgXOKF8gSah675t2whMaNMpolEePACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-SQU6puJ8Tgs/YRLHUbQdP3I/AAAAAAAAuhU/b37ZZgXOKF8gSah675t2whMaNMpolEePACLcBGAsYHQ/w452-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kings of ages past.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-are-kings&#34;&gt;Why Are Kings? &lt;a href=&#34;#why-are-kings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the essential nature of Man. We are, in the most literal sense, monstrous consumers. There isn&amp;rsquo;t an easy solution. Humanity has a problem, and the problem is Kings; but the individual Kings aren&amp;rsquo;t the source, they just happen to be at the top of the pile for now. If there wasn&amp;rsquo;t a High King, everyone would be King, and that would be even worse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably why elfs hate you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-utVJpT0eCE0/YRLMUWe2iyI/AAAAAAAAuhc/8xGFegMGHSoxGLvfjv5qA_QSWnE7tm9vACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-utVJpT0eCE0/YRLMUWe2iyI/AAAAAAAAuhc/8xGFegMGHSoxGLvfjv5qA_QSWnE7tm9vACLcBGAsYHQ/w515-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;No Kings, taskmasters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-digression-on-dwarfs&#34;&gt;A Digression On Dwarfs &lt;a href=&#34;#a-digression-on-dwarfs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you want to fix Kings, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, abolish the entire feudal system, the whole damn thing, and probably create a weapon that will destroy Kung Fu. Industrialize past it. Develop &lt;strong&gt;capitalism&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;state capitalism&lt;/strong&gt;. That&amp;rsquo;s what the dwarfs did (both/all of the above). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That will, of course, cause other problems, and the dwarfs are here to prove it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dwarfs used to be something much like Man, but they industrialized. They evolved beyond having Kings, and the parts of them that would become Kings atrophied and withered away to leave them something somewhat less than Man. That&amp;rsquo;s why they&amp;rsquo;re smaller than people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Half of the dwarfs are **capitalist **and the other half are &lt;strong&gt;state capitalist&lt;/strong&gt;. The two halfs are, of course, at vicious and unending war. Dwarfs don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;consume&lt;/strong&gt;, they &lt;strong&gt;hoard&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;mise.&lt;/strong&gt; They eat only as much as they need to be &lt;strong&gt;productive&lt;/strong&gt;. When &lt;strong&gt;Dwarf Reagan&lt;/strong&gt; dies he&amp;rsquo;ll leave behind a stockpile of cave wheat and plump helmets sufficient to feed all the Kings of Man for a day, and when &lt;strong&gt;Dwarf Stalin&lt;/strong&gt; dies all he will leave behind is a pair of boots and a pickaxe (because &lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; stockpile belongs to the &lt;em&gt;state&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;capitalist&lt;/strong&gt; dwarfs sell giant armor and cannon to the Kings for their wars against each other, then laugh about Man&amp;rsquo;s backward, King-having ways once they are gone, their business concluded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;communist&lt;/strong&gt; dwarfs back revolutionaries among the Kingdoms of Man, sending them arms and material and subverting their aims towards bureaucratic power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zhlbnBi3fys/YRLP9GnaKnI/AAAAAAAAuhk/WpJI_67rzrUuF0DhXFIwbZv2JXcbhtdjwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zhlbnBi3fys/YRLP9GnaKnI/AAAAAAAAuhk/WpJI_67rzrUuF0DhXFIwbZv2JXcbhtdjwCLcBGAsYHQ/w348-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I just can&amp;rsquo;t wait to be King.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;how-do-i-become-king&#34;&gt;How Do I Become King? &lt;a href=&#34;#how-do-i-become-king&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Easy, you eat one. It&amp;rsquo;s hard not to, once you&amp;rsquo;ve done the work of killing him: A King-corpse calls to the soul (and stomach) of all true Men. If you eat a King you become a King, no tricks or gotchas. You also become an &lt;strong&gt;NPC&lt;/strong&gt;, but you can make your new character at the level of your old one (that just became a King) &lt;strong&gt;plus one.&lt;/strong&gt; Tempting, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, if you get yourself into a situation where you&amp;rsquo;re a King in all but name, it&amp;rsquo;ll probably happen on its own anyway. Difficult to escape, the Divine Right of Kings (to eat people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-V0NGLIprhps/YRLiDyZUzRI/AAAAAAAAuhs/gdn8kzWh4kwPDJYaiwR0Pdkvps6WiNndQCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-V0NGLIprhps/YRLiDyZUzRI/AAAAAAAAuhs/gdn8kzWh4kwPDJYaiwR0Pdkvps6WiNndQCLcBGAsYHQ/w469-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A King on his throne.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-does-it-mean-to-be-king&#34;&gt;What Does It Mean To Be King? &lt;a href=&#34;#what-does-it-mean-to-be-king&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong&gt;huge&lt;/strong&gt;. Petty Kings are about &lt;strong&gt;12&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; tall with &lt;strong&gt;4 &lt;strong&gt;(extra) &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;+4 STR&lt;/strong&gt;. I guess for each tier of King above that, you just double that number, so maybe there are some Old Kings that are &lt;strong&gt;24&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; tall with &lt;strong&gt;8&lt;/strong&gt;(extra)&lt;/strong&gt; HD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;+8 STR&lt;/strong&gt;, and the High King is &lt;strong&gt;36&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; tall with &lt;strong&gt;12&lt;/strong&gt;(extra)** HD** and &lt;strong&gt;+12 STR&lt;/strong&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a good thing the Great Kings, Emperors, and First King are all long dead and you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about how big &lt;em&gt;they&lt;/em&gt; must have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second of all, they&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong&gt;commanding&lt;/strong&gt;. A King has one &lt;strong&gt;Majesty Die&lt;/strong&gt; for each tier of size he is, which he can roll to boss people around in much the same way a Wizard uses &lt;strong&gt;Magic Dice&lt;/strong&gt; to boss around &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;. A King also gets &lt;strong&gt;+1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; for (each of) wearing a &lt;strong&gt;crown&lt;/strong&gt;, wielding a &lt;strong&gt;scepter&lt;/strong&gt;, or sitting on a &lt;strong&gt;throne&lt;/strong&gt; of suitable opulence for his station in the exact same way that a Wizard gets &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; for wearing a sufficiently magical Wizard Robe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Majesty Dice&lt;/strong&gt; automatically work on anyone the King can be said to rule, and never work on other Kings (even lesser ones). &lt;strong&gt;PCs&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;anarchists&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;the subjects of other Kings&lt;/strong&gt;, and so on fall somewhere in the middle and get to &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;. Histories tell of Kings who could &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/06/god-throat-paladins.html&#34;&gt;command&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; seas to part, skies to clear, and Men to fall dead on the spot, but that art has been lost or else is being carefully concealed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a King eats another King that&amp;rsquo;s bigger than he is, he absorbs his mass with 100% efficiency. The new King is the size of both Kings added together. When a King eats another King smaller than he is, or anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t a King, he digests them and shits out the bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tYqnag0Owdg/YRLsb2jgRWI/AAAAAAAAuh0/IC3RU9jExBcROlijTiICypuZYPBlJHr3QCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-tYqnag0Owdg/YRLsb2jgRWI/AAAAAAAAuh0/IC3RU9jExBcROlijTiICypuZYPBlJHr3QCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this post done? Did I forget anything? How do you kill the High King and end feudalism properly, without taking his place? Where do the elfs come in? These are the questions which must be answered, if we are to progress as a people.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>He Who Greets the Sun with a Hymn Does Not Notice the Small Spots (Class: Paladin)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/07/he-who-greets-sun-with-hymn-does-not.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 18 Jul 2021 14:44:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/07/he-who-greets-sun-with-hymn-does-not.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The final &amp;ldquo;base class&amp;rdquo; for the Mountain, just in time&lt;strong&gt;at least a week and a half too late&lt;/strong&gt; for me to run a game. These owe, obviously, a great debt to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;masked clerics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;G_d&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShTS1smbtss/YOYr01bu1mI/AAAAAAAAuJM/0dNhvJEJ1Bgb8xdzWHFpc80D39s9xO5UACLcBGAsYHQ/s863/Minors%252BWands%252B03.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ShTS1smbtss/YOYr01bu1mI/AAAAAAAAuJM/0dNhvJEJ1Bgb8xdzWHFpc80D39s9xO5UACLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h640/Minors%252BWands%252B03.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three of Wands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;class-paladin&#34;&gt;Class: Paladin &lt;a href=&#34;#class-paladin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every paladin has a Revelation; a vision which causes them to break with the dogma of the Church and leads them to the Mountain on a divine mission. Every paladin is a prophet, an apostate, and a heretic, blessed with divine self-righteousness and strength of faith; it is they who have heard the word of G_d, they who speak holy truth, and they who decide what is divine necessity and what is false ceremony.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a big Church back in the Civilized Lands, with complex theology and dogma and all of that nonsense. You&amp;rsquo;re not connected to it and don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about any of that. You may end up with one or two strictures by virtue of your Revelation and Miracles, but that&amp;rsquo;s it. The things you do are holy by definition; feel free to associate with &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/07/something-wicked-this-way-comes-class.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;witches&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thiefs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and by your presence they shall be redeemed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every template of Paladin you have gives you &lt;strong&gt;+1 to resisting coercion and withstanding hardship.&lt;/strong&gt; Your second and fourth templates also each give you &lt;strong&gt;+1 to-hit.&lt;/strong&gt; My system doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually have &lt;strong&gt;proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; so I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I keep listing them off like it does and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Farming &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Rhetoric** 3.** Prophecy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;holy symbol&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;short stave&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;practical clothing&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;rucksack&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;wool blanket&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;waterskin&lt;/strong&gt;, 3** torches**, 3 &lt;strong&gt;iron rations&lt;/strong&gt;, 50&amp;rsquo; of stout hempen &lt;strong&gt;rope&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;book of hymns and folk songs&lt;/strong&gt;, and one &lt;strong&gt;relic&lt;/strong&gt; from the list at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Orisons, First Revelation&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Miracles, +1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Fury, Second Revelation&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Coronation, +1 MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Orisons&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At will, you may do any of the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conjure a torch-sized flame into your cupped palm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Consecrate a man-made flame of bonfire size or smaller, causing it to produce no ash nor smoke.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refuse to be burned by any fire of not-specifically-malicious intent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Know the position of the sun, the approximate time and exact date, and which cardinal direction you are facing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Revelation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a paladin, you have received a revelation; a prophetic vision with more weight and detail to it than the nightmarish dreams suffered by most who are called to the Mountain, shewing them a potential End of the World as well as a means by which it may be averted. Each paladin&amp;rsquo;s revelation is unique, but four broad themes seem to be present:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Revelation of the Hearth (Choirs)&lt;br&gt;
**_Throngs of the faithful gather around great bonfires to repel the assault of infernal forces, vast armies of black glass and iridescent chitin. We&amp;rsquo;re strongest together; our bonds are our might.&lt;br&gt;
_Those who have received the revelation of the hearth know that there is nothing greater than what people can achieve in companionship. Their most important duty is to find allies against the darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hearth paladins shave and tattoo their heads and bodies, and are sometimes called Choirs. Their &lt;strong&gt;primary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they may not cause harm to one who has not acted violently in their presence, and their &lt;strong&gt;secondary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they must not consume the flesh nor eggs of anything with or without a face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Castigation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;first revelation&lt;/strong&gt;, your voice cannot be &lt;strong&gt;ignored&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;muffled&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;muted&lt;/strong&gt;. When you spend an action to deliver curses and invective with appropriate gravity, your target must check &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt;. If they &lt;strong&gt;succeed&lt;/strong&gt;, they must primarily target you for the remainder of the encounter—&lt;strong&gt;failure&lt;/strong&gt; means they break, flee, etc as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/06/god-throat-paladins.html&#34;&gt;God&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/11/osr-class-paladin-of-word.html&#34;&gt;Throat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;second revelation&lt;/strong&gt; you gain the service of the &lt;strong&gt;angel&lt;/strong&gt; known as _WORD, _so styled because she answers to many names. Her dossier can be found at the end of the list of &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; far below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation of Gunpowder (Judges)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_Steel-eyed inquisitors plumb the depths of the world, unearthing great fiends in their lairs and striking them down. Victory can be won only _&lt;em&gt;by discovering and destroying the greatest evils before they can destroy us.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those who have received the revelation of gunpowder know that they are soldiers in an unending war. Their most important duty is to slay the enemies of righteousness before they are able to act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gunpowder paladins weave wooden tokens into their hair, wear muted colors, wield hammers and pistols, and are sometimes called Judges or Inquisitors. Their &lt;strong&gt;primary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they must not turn their back on an opportunity to destroy or prevent evil, and their &lt;strong&gt;secondary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they may not carry nor wield bladed instruments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Bloodhound&lt;br&gt;
**Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;first revelation&lt;/strong&gt; your senses are finely attuned to signs beyond the purely physical, allowing you to &lt;strong&gt;smell&lt;/strong&gt; the distinctive reek of &lt;strong&gt;secrecy&lt;/strong&gt;. This won&amp;rsquo;t tell you anything &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; secrets except their existence, but is of great help in discovering traps, secret doors and compartments, people who are trying to hide, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Veritas Dei&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;second revelation&lt;/strong&gt; your very soul revolts against falsehood, causing you &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; damage for each consciously spoken untruth you utter and allowing you to &lt;strong&gt;see lies&lt;/strong&gt; and instinctively judge the &lt;strong&gt;weight of souls&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation of the Torch (Contemplatives)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A lone hero scales an infinite incline, torch held high, tested mentally, physically, and in spirit. The only one who can be counted on, in the end, is oneself; so each must individually become the best, strongest self possible if we are to survive as a whole.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those who have received the revelation of the torch know that relentless self-improvement is the highest virtue. Their most important duty is to better themselves in every fashion—become stronger, healthier, more virtuous, better educated_—_and to help others do the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torch paladins oil their bodies and bare their hands and feet, and are sometimes called Apotheosites, Templar, and Contemplatives. Their &lt;strong&gt;primary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they must test themselves against the strong and vice versa, and their &lt;strong&gt;secondary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they may not tell to others what they have not witnessed themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sacred Martial Arts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;first revelation&lt;/strong&gt; your fists, knees, elbows, forehead, and any other part of your body you could conceivably strike someone with are are &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapons, and you are a &lt;strong&gt;skilled wrestler&lt;/strong&gt;. When you hit someone with a melee attack, you can attempt a free &lt;strong&gt;combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; against them if you name and describe your action as a &lt;strong&gt;special move&lt;/strong&gt; (or use one previously named and described that makes sense in context). You can&amp;rsquo;t use the same &lt;strong&gt;special move&lt;/strong&gt; twice in the same combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Force Projection&lt;br&gt;
**Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;second revelation&lt;/strong&gt; you master techniques of hand-to-hand combat far beyond the normal limits of human achievement. Your unarmed melee attacks have a &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; reach and you can run on walls, spikes, or water as long as you end your turn on solid footing. Additional &lt;strong&gt;secret techniques&lt;/strong&gt; may become available to you in your travels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revelation of the Mirror (Scriveners)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Scholars delve deep in libraries and laboratories, their frenetic study essential despite the calamity outside, until finally, finally, the Secret which justifies any consequence is uncovered, the Work complete. Something terrible is Coming, and we&amp;rsquo;d be foolish indeed to discard any weapon which might be raised against it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Those who have received the revelation of the mirror know that all the evils of the world pale in comparison to the great enemy that comes against it, and that the right or wrong of a sword or rifle lie in the hands that wield it. Their most important duty is to seek out power and knowledge that is lost, disdained, forgotten or forbidden.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mirrored paladins cover their faces—with blank-featured or silvered masks when possible, or simple cloth when not—and are sometimes called Lenses, Silverfish, Warminds, and Scriveners. Their ****primary &lt;strong&gt;restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they may not consciously allow knowledge to be lost, and their &lt;strong&gt;secondary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; is that they must share knowledge with any who, in their estimation, should make use of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy Seals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;first revelation&lt;/strong&gt;, each time you command an &lt;strong&gt;angel&lt;/strong&gt; you may cause up to &lt;strong&gt;[templates]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;blessed seals&lt;/strong&gt; in your possession to spontaneously combust: For each that does, you may &lt;strong&gt;add&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;replace&lt;/strong&gt; one &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;. You can produce new &lt;strong&gt;seals&lt;/strong&gt; out of &lt;strong&gt;10 sp&lt;/strong&gt; in wax, art supplies, and precious metals, at a rate of one per day as a part of your normal rest, and they each take up &lt;strong&gt;1/3&lt;/strong&gt; of a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You also gain the ability to perceive and communicate with the spirit world slightly earlier than your fellows, and the services of one &lt;strong&gt;angel&lt;/strong&gt; rolled on the list from the end with &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; rather than &lt;strong&gt;1d12&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coronal Mass Ejection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Upon receiving your &lt;strong&gt;second revelation&lt;/strong&gt; you are able to resurrect a technique from the holy books long thought apocryphal: The ability to project an exploding laser beam directly out of your forehead at one billion miles per hour. Once per combat round, you may deal &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; holy fire damage to anything you can see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Breaking your &lt;strong&gt;secondary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; causes an immediate &lt;strong&gt;mishap&lt;/strong&gt;. Breaking your &lt;strong&gt;primary restriction&lt;/strong&gt; causes an immediate &lt;strong&gt;doom&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Miracles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The world of &lt;strong&gt;spirits&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; reveals itself to you, and you gain the service of an &lt;strong&gt;angel&lt;/strong&gt; (roll &lt;strong&gt;1d12&lt;/strong&gt;) whom you are able to command through the use of &lt;strong&gt;Miracle Dice&lt;/strong&gt; in exactly the same way someone else might cast a spell with &lt;strong&gt;Magic Dice&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The saints of the Church are numerous, and each day of the year is the &lt;strong&gt;feast day&lt;/strong&gt; of one or more, with collisions being the source of fierce dogmatic arguments. Your &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; are replenished at &lt;strong&gt;dawn&lt;/strong&gt; at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; per each of the following saintly attributes you are able to declare—up to your maximum &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;—regardless of whether you &lt;strong&gt;rested&lt;/strong&gt; or not:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Name and/or title&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Portfolio&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saintly deeds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Method of martyrdom&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ritual observances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example you might declare, &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;Today is the day of Giuseppe the Maligned, patron saint of psychiatry and comedy, who restored the grand mural of the Holy City, and was cast from a high cliff, and on whose day we must turn every handshake into an arm-wrestle,&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; and have declared all five attributes, and regain up to &lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; if you somehow have that many which should be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upon gaining template &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;, you receive the services of a second &lt;strong&gt;angel&lt;/strong&gt; of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Fury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When engaged in &lt;strong&gt;melee&lt;/strong&gt; combat, you may make one extra attack each round for free. The extra attack doesn&amp;rsquo;t, technically, have to be a melee one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Coronation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You develop a &lt;strong&gt;blessed halo&lt;/strong&gt;, the surest sign of your divine significance. This takes the form of either a diffuse radiance projected around your body or a hard-edged circlet of light hovering over your head. Regardless of its form, it &lt;strong&gt;casts light as a torch&lt;/strong&gt; and protects you from harm, granting &lt;strong&gt;+1 AC&lt;/strong&gt;. It is also &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rSj172HizUw/YPOjLG-McwI/AAAAAAAAuPY/pD6oE7cpfUU7rx0BA8j8Eskl0PMTzUrfwCLcBGAsYHQ/s900/05-clarke-faust_900.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-rSj172HizUw/YPOjLG-McwI/AAAAAAAAuPY/pD6oE7cpfUU7rx0BA8j8Eskl0PMTzUrfwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h422/05-clarke-faust_900.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt;**Angels&lt;br&gt;
** &lt;a href=&#34;#heading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;spellcaster&lt;/strong&gt;, you are able to perceive and communicate with the spirits known commonly as &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;. As a &lt;strong&gt;paladin&lt;/strong&gt;, those available to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to command (by means of your &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;) are termed &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;handmaidens of G_d&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; may exist, and you may be able to bribe, coerce, or otherwise convince them to join you. By the same token, experienced paladins and such met in the wild may travel with &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; outside this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Missile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is clad in a sleekly articulated plate harness, and wields a brace of darts which become visible when she casts them at a target. She is blunt in her manner and could be seen as arrogant, were her aim any less true.&lt;br&gt;
_Throws &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; darts, each of which unerringly strikes a target of your choice within sight for &lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt; damage. The darts of your Missile are formed from hard-edged white light and resemble&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dueling swords&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spears&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Needles&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Birds of prey&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Longswords&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throwing knives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Circles or discs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shuriken&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sidewinders&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burning Hands&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is four-armed and muscular, bare from the waist up. Her fists are ever-clenched, each wreathed in flames too hot to fully consider.&lt;br&gt;
_Heats the palms of your hands to a significant fraction of the temperature of the sun for &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes, while protecting you from the effects thereof. This is probably sufficient to melt through at least &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; inches of stone or steel, set flammable objects on fire, fuse sand into brittle glass, and so on, and you may reroll all invested &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; as damage dice when open-palm slapping someone with them. Alternatively, holding your hands up palm-outward is probably sufficient to ward away most potential threats without actual violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scorching Ray&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_Her bare head floats in the midst of a conflagration and heat haze, her body—if she has one—fully concealed. Her eyes burn a blank and angry red. She is colorblind.&lt;br&gt;
_Projects up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; rays of burning energy towards a target or targets of your choice within bowshot. Make a ranged attack roll against &lt;strong&gt;AC 10&lt;/strong&gt; for each; any that hit deal &lt;strong&gt;[best]&lt;/strong&gt; damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fireball&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is ineffably majestic, impossibly beautiful, a Queen among &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; crowned by a third eye upon her brow and framed by nine wings behind her. She wears a fractally ornate gown and does not speak so much as command.&lt;br&gt;
_Streaks to the designated area within bowshot and explodes, dealing &lt;strong&gt;[sum] + [dice]&lt;/strong&gt; damage to everything within a &lt;strong&gt;20&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; radius with a &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is tense, almost nervous, filled with energy, a slightly sinister cast to her expressions. She is eager to create her effect, and has been known to&lt;/em&gt;_—under very specific circumstances__—disobey orders.&lt;br&gt;
_Swoops through an area &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; wide and &lt;strong&gt;[dice]*10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; long, dealing &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt;** + [dice]** damage to anyone and anything in her path with a &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Supernova&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is serene, radiant, beatific in both bearing and conduct. She dresses for mourning, and her eyes are sad.&lt;br&gt;
_Causes the targeted corpse to crumple inward and then explode in a flare of brilliant energy, dealing &lt;strong&gt;[sum] * 2&lt;/strong&gt; damage to everything within a &lt;strong&gt;20&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; radius with a **DEX **roll for half. If targeted on an undead that you do not personally control, they may roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid exploding. Requires a minimum investment of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; proportionate to the size of corpse she is to detonate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; A hobgoblin, orc, or smaller &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; A bugbear, horse, minotaur, or smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; An elephant, ogre, or smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; A whale, giant, or smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - A dragon, kraken, or smaller&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;9&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall of Fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She wears a general officer&amp;rsquo;s uniform in an unfamiliar pattern, resplendent with medals and ribbons and braid. She has excellent tactical instincts, but a poor grasp of modern technology.&lt;br&gt;
_Conjures up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo; × 10&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;×&lt;/strong&gt; 5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; sheets of searing flame, within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, in whatever contiguous formation you desire and lasting for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. Any who enter or begin their turn within the area take &lt;strong&gt;[dice]d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage, and catch fire for an additional &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage per round until extinguished. If placed over a creature, they may roll &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; in order to escape the area before the sheets manifest. If cast with &lt;strong&gt;3 or more MD&lt;/strong&gt;, her conjured wall instead lasts for **[sum] **hours. If cast with &lt;strong&gt;4 or more MD&lt;/strong&gt;, it is permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Radiate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is slender and completely hairless, clad in a loose, gauzy shift. Her skeleton is starkly visible through her skin and garment. She perceives the world in wavelengths impossible to us, and does not understand the fragility of humans.&lt;br&gt;
_Causes the targeted object within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw to radiate energy for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, of a type dependent on how many &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; were invested in her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; Casts &lt;strong&gt;bright&lt;/strong&gt; illumination out to &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, warms like a hearth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; Casts &lt;strong&gt;bright&lt;/strong&gt; illumination within sight range, counts as &lt;strong&gt;sunlight&lt;/strong&gt;, warms like a pyre.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; Casts invisible rays of &lt;strong&gt;blinding heat&lt;/strong&gt;, deals &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; damage per round within &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, any who look at it within that range roll &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; or are permanently blinded. Blocked by anything sufficiently opaque.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; Casts intangible rays of &lt;strong&gt;poison fire&lt;/strong&gt;, deals &lt;strong&gt;[dice] STR&lt;/strong&gt; damage per round within &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to all targets, including other &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;, et cetera. Only blocked by lead or stone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glory&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She is thick-wristed and -ankled, her face hidden behind a golden caricature mask with a giant, spiked halo affixed to its edges. She bears two massive golden swords which she wields in elaborate flourishes, and is fond of elaborate posing to punctuate her words.&lt;br&gt;
_Increases your &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; by &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; each and grants you immunity to &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;, and other &lt;strong&gt;maladies&lt;/strong&gt; for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. The additional &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; you gain from increased &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; are lost, in this case, before your &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_She appears metal-fleshed, her limbs delicate armatures of piston and ball-joint beneath ornamented silver plating. She speaks only to narrate threat coefficients, with flat affect. Her appellative Shield is starkly utilitarian in contrast, a round-cornered rectangle of undecorated polished steel. &lt;br&gt;
_Uses her &lt;em&gt;Shield&lt;/em&gt; to defend you or a target of your choice within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach, granting &lt;strong&gt;+[dice] AC&lt;/strong&gt; for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours against any attack she is aware of and completely negating &lt;em&gt;Missiles&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Rays&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_Wears a linen robe, clinical, detached, omits names and pronouns when speaking. _&lt;em&gt;Seen it all before, twice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Heals the touched target for &lt;strong&gt;[sum] + [dice]&lt;/strong&gt; HP. Alternatively, can be directed to solve specific problems depending on the &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**1 MD - **No alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Mend broken bones or other long-term wounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Cure a malady such as disease or poison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Reattach recently severed limbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Regrow missing limbs or organs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;16&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is a sinister figure in white, blindfolded, bound in chains and one of those funny jackets that won&amp;rsquo;t let you check your wristwatch. She speaks in a piercing, imperious voice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Closes and locks (if applicable; doors slam shut, drawbridges slam up, half-drawn swords slam back in their scabbards) a target within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, then &lt;em&gt;Holds&lt;/em&gt; it in place for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds. If the target is secured, attended, or sapient, &lt;em&gt;Hold&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;[dice] level&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;+[best] STR&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;skilled&lt;/strong&gt; at wrestling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SWzv9e8V2zONLM6usvZe4_9uyoFwhpTQcZzLYyvZkag/edit#heading=h.d9mea1w854m2&#34;&gt;WORD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is dressed unassumingly in simple linen and scripture—the latter crawling over every inch of her skin. Her features are regal, more imposing than they are appealing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Delivers a divine pronouncement of up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; words, using her &lt;strong&gt;WORD&lt;/strong&gt; as the main verb. Targets may not be specified except as a part of the pronouncement—speak carefully. Those with souls or personalities may roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid or reduce direct effects. If used to harm something with an &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; value, she will usually deal &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage as well as any incidental effects of the &lt;strong&gt;WORD&lt;/strong&gt; used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Roll two &lt;strong&gt;WORDs&lt;/strong&gt; from the following list by which you may call your &lt;em&gt;WORD&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;g_dly-mishaps&#34;&gt;G_dly Mishaps &lt;a href=&#34;#g_dly-mishaps&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You attract a **crow or raven **which will forevermore follow and spy on you when you are under open sky. If trapped or killed, the corvid is replaced within &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your eyes turn smoky black, &lt;strong&gt;blinding&lt;/strong&gt; you for &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds. They do not clear fully, leaving you with at least one permanent sunspot in your vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your wounds and scars open and &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; fat, three-inch-long maggots plop sickeningly out at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;one per round&lt;/strong&gt;. Each maggot that drops deals you &lt;strong&gt;1 damage&lt;/strong&gt;. The maggots taste like motor oil, and anyone eating one heals &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your head is transformed into that of a dog for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes, granting you the ability to speak and understand &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;Arqot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; but unable to converse in any other language for the duration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dogs, horses, and other domesticated animals will see you as a &lt;strong&gt;hated enemy&lt;/strong&gt; until the next dawn, and either attack you viciously or flee in terror depending on temperament.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your reflection fades by about &lt;strong&gt;⅒&lt;/strong&gt; of its original opacity. This effect is permanent, and stacks—after &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; fadings, you no longer have a reflection. Further results cause a different reflection to fade back in at the same rate; one with no visible resemblance to you, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t match up to your movements. Once your reflection has faded &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; times out and &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; times back in, its negative is as real as its positive once was. &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; more and it&amp;rsquo;s as real as you are yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;doom-of-the-sun&#34;&gt;Doom of the Sun &lt;a href=&#34;#doom-of-the-sun&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You become able to hear the voice of the &lt;strong&gt;Sun&lt;/strong&gt;. It is sonorous, commanding, quintuply resonant. The loudest voice speaks in an obtuse language which bears resemblances to both &lt;strong&gt;angelfire&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;old tongue&lt;/strong&gt;, and can be understood if you speak either of those languages. It is very distracting, causing a &lt;strong&gt;-2 penalty&lt;/strong&gt; to all &lt;strong&gt;d20&lt;/strong&gt; rolls when exposed to natural sunlight, reduced to &lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt; if only partially exposed such as while indoors or under an overcast sky.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunlight&lt;/strong&gt; pours forth from your eyes and mouth whenever they are open, casting &lt;strong&gt;bright&lt;/strong&gt; illumination in a &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; cone. The penalty is no longer escapable, even with your eyes and mouth held shut.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You emit &lt;strong&gt;sunlight&lt;/strong&gt; from your entire body, casting &lt;strong&gt;bright&lt;/strong&gt; illumination in an unlimited radius and &lt;strong&gt;blinding&lt;/strong&gt; any who look directly at you. The voice of the &lt;strong&gt;Sun&lt;/strong&gt; is now audible to others in your presence and inflicts the same penalty on them, and for you personally the penalty is &lt;strong&gt;doubled&lt;/strong&gt; and sufficient to prevent you from commanding any &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doom of the Sun can be escaped by seeing the Sun destroyed, or by journeying to its surface and consuming a piece of whatever rules there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy Symbol.&lt;/strong&gt; An eight rayed sun-disk, traditionally copper but sometimes wood or gold. Yours is bigger than most, but it still doesn&amp;rsquo;t take up any slots as long as you&amp;rsquo;re wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Short Staff.&lt;/strong&gt; A sturdy inch-thick dowel of somewhat less than your height, making it a &lt;strong&gt;medium&lt;/strong&gt; weapon while retaining some effectiveness as a walking stick. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Practical Clothing.&lt;/strong&gt; Sturdy wool and linen, unassuming, humble. 0 slots worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wool Blanket.&lt;/strong&gt; Large enough to wrap oneself in fully, or double up and wear as a cloak. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterskin.&lt;/strong&gt; Essential. 1 slot when full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Torches.&lt;/strong&gt; Simple sticks wrapped in hessian and soaked in pitch or wax. Burn for an hour each, cast &lt;strong&gt;bright&lt;/strong&gt; light out to &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dim&lt;/strong&gt; light twice that distance. 1 slot total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Iron Rations.&lt;/strong&gt; Thick cakes of preserved meat, parched grain, and chocolate. Won&amp;rsquo;t go bad for &lt;em&gt;months&lt;/em&gt; as long as you keep them dry. 1 slot total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;50&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Hempen Rope.&lt;/strong&gt; Coarse, thick, and unpleasant to the hand. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book of Hymns and Folk Songs.&lt;/strong&gt; Lyrics and rough melodies; not detailed scores. Heavily annotated in at least three hands, before including yours. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottle of &lt;strong&gt;Holy Water.&lt;/strong&gt; Spiritually active, powerfully caustic to &lt;strong&gt;devils&lt;/strong&gt; and some forms of &lt;strong&gt;undead.&lt;/strong&gt; Drinking it cures **demon-**caused maladies. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reactive Sledge.&lt;/strong&gt; A sacred tool of &lt;strong&gt;gunpowder paladins.&lt;/strong&gt; A **heavy **weapon which explodes when struck hard against something to deal an additional &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage in a **5&amp;rsquo; **radius (including to the wielder), **DEX **half. 2 slots, one use only.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 &lt;strong&gt;Blessed Seals.&lt;/strong&gt; Heavily decorated discs of stamped, gilded wax. A **mirrored paladin **may be able to make use of them. 1 slot total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Book of Church Secrets.&lt;/strong&gt; An unpleasant accounting. Could be used as blackmail, or to get someone in a lot of trouble. Someone who might be you. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prayer Beads.&lt;/strong&gt; Very soothing to fiddle with, grants &lt;strong&gt;advantage&lt;/strong&gt; on saves against &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt; and the like when wielded. No slots, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Censer.&lt;/strong&gt; Silver, ornate, suspended on three feet of fine chain. &lt;strong&gt;Angels&lt;/strong&gt; and other &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; are attracted to the scent of incense burned in it. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursed Incense.&lt;/strong&gt; Reminds any who smell it of their own mortality, and puts them in a foul mood. Not actually cursed, just universally culturally significant. 10 doses, no slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pistol&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;shot&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;powder.&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; firearm which deals &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; damage, takes &lt;strong&gt;4 full rounds&lt;/strong&gt; to reload, and can be safely fired in melee combat. 1/3 slot for the pistol itself, 1 slot each for 10 rounds and a horn with 10 doses of powder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Dog.&lt;/strong&gt; Man&amp;rsquo;s best friend. Happy, friendly, &lt;strong&gt;1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, good at searching things out and eating garbage and not at all good at fighting. 3 slots if you have to carry it around for some reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;Horse.&lt;/strong&gt; Would ordinarily be man&amp;rsquo;s other best friend, but this one is ill-tempered, cloven-hooved, long-tongued, fond of eating carrion, and refuses to be ridden. &lt;strong&gt;3 HD&lt;/strong&gt;, much too big to carry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something &lt;strong&gt;weird&lt;/strong&gt;. Roll &lt;strong&gt;1d6:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Golden wedding band. Powerfully cursed, has some weird writing inside it, attracts &lt;strong&gt;ghosts&lt;/strong&gt; when worn. You&amp;rsquo;re supposed to throw this into a pit at the heart of the Mountain, I think. No slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The true Tao. You&amp;rsquo;re not supposed to be able to write this down, but someone did on a scroll about &lt;strong&gt;1&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; wide and &lt;strong&gt;3&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; long and now nobody knows what to do with it. Solid (and inviolable) to &lt;strong&gt;ghosts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jeweler&amp;rsquo;s loupe. Displays a number above the head of each person observed through it commensurate to the quality of their &lt;strong&gt;kung fu&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Socks woven from the hair of a saint. Refuse to touch impure things, allowing you to (with practice) hover above the surface of seawater, uncut grass, &amp;amp;c. No slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An endpaper torn from the first holy book. Completely blank, blackens in the presence of elfs and giants. Do not burn it. No slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NOT A SWORD&lt;/strong&gt;, name scratched crudely into scabbard. He is a **+0 heavy **sword (&lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt;) of make indeterminate due to being completely rusted into his scabbard. Believes he has been fighting an bitter war against completely imagined enemies for the past millennia. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t count as bearing an edge, in case you&amp;rsquo;re a &lt;strong&gt;gunpowder paladin&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Do You Not Realize from What I Say to You Who I Am? (Class: False Witch)</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A continuation of the Work of preparing PC classes for the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. These in particular are archetypes for my &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html&#34;&gt;Ultimate Thief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html&#34;&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False Witches. They&amp;rsquo;re called Witches because they use magic. They&amp;rsquo;re called False because they aren&amp;rsquo;t actually magical at all themselves. They are, basically, specialists or thieves or rogues or what have you. Scientists. People who have figured out how to manipulate the world in specific ways, without ever performing something that we&amp;rsquo;d call magic directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re a lot easier to run out of town or burn at the stake, etc, than real witches are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ertNxL1_aN8/YOIHeCD-XQI/AAAAAAAAuHo/VmEY4jSIc1kVRy6PgUWgkCMnn3t8WdCKQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1554/Minors%252BSwords%252B05.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ertNxL1_aN8/YOIHeCD-XQI/AAAAAAAAuHo/VmEY4jSIc1kVRy6PgUWgkCMnn3t8WdCKQCLcBGAsYHQ/w371-h640/Minors%252BSwords%252B05.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five of Swords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;archetype-sword-witch&#34;&gt;Archetype: Sword Witch &lt;a href=&#34;#archetype-sword-witch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_The sword is the ultimate tool—you can hunt with them, eat with them, use them to start a fire or cut down a tree, and they’re the primary symbol of skill at arms across the world. _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; archetype, properly speaking, but I suppose I can&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; stop you from jamming it on something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Equipment: &lt;strong&gt;A MAGIC SWORD&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;normal sword&lt;/strong&gt;,** dark clothing**, a &lt;strong&gt;waterskin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;3 days trail rations&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;bullseye lantern&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flint&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;oil&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;soft boots&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefit: You can carry any number of swords tied into a bundle in the space of the largest single one you possess, and draw blades from it unerringly without spending an action. You can identify all properties of a blade by fucking around with it for an hour. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t speak &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;swordsong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; already, you do now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawback: Your &lt;strong&gt;opportunism&lt;/strong&gt; only works on sword attacks. Sword-wielders will be naturally jealous of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1d12-startingmagic-swords-or-1d8-if-youre-small&#34;&gt;1d12 Starting Magic Swords (or 1d8 if you&amp;rsquo;re Small) &lt;a href=&#34;#1d12-startingmagic-swords-or-1d8-if-youre-small&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GONE TOO FAR&lt;/strong&gt;, sings name when drawn. He is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 medium&lt;/strong&gt; langmesser (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of silvered bone, with horsehide-bound hilt and double blade. Can sever and reattach hands without causing damage. The formerly handed retain control over them while severed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CANNIBAL MEAT EATER&lt;/strong&gt;, name engraved on blade. They are a &lt;strong&gt;+0 medium&lt;/strong&gt; shamshir (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of leaden copper, wolfshead pommel, and square guard. Devours sharpness of other blades when pressed against them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TAKEN AND LOST&lt;/strong&gt;, name known by all. It is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 medium&lt;/strong&gt; takouba (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of mercurial black iron, with leechglass guard. Grants wielder &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; echolocation when speaking name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SOME ASSEMBLY REQUIRED&lt;/strong&gt;, name engraved in fuller. She is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 medium&lt;/strong&gt; tulwar (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of arsenical bronze, with ring pommel and small spinels in guard. Those slain by the blade will grant haruspecious insight through examination of their entrails.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PROBLEMS YET UNSOLVED&lt;/strong&gt;, spells name in spilled blood. He is a &lt;strong&gt;+1 medium&lt;/strong&gt; bastard sword (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of steel, with sheepskin-bound hilt. Those slain by the blade will trade faces permanently with the wielder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WINNING A FIGHT&lt;/strong&gt;, name known by all. She is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 medium&lt;/strong&gt; falchion (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of iridian steel, with ring pommel and triangle pattern of dark-and-light along blade. Knows what the face of G_d looks like, and loudly announces match percentage of anything she is pointed at.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO FACED BITCH&lt;/strong&gt;, name engraved on blade. He is a &lt;strong&gt;+2&lt;/strong&gt; **medium **dadao (&lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt;) of mithril, with round pommel. Refuses to be drawn against anyone with better &lt;strong&gt;kung fu&lt;/strong&gt; than yours.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHAME IN DEFEAT,&lt;/strong&gt; name engraved in fuller. She is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 heavy&lt;/strong&gt; greatsword (&lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt;) of thorian black iron, with missing pommel. Her destruction will cause a natural disaster.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SEVEN STARS SHINE&lt;/strong&gt;, whispers name when drawn. She is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 heavy&lt;/strong&gt; longsword (&lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt;) of ironwood, with yew hilt. Can harm &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;demons&lt;/strong&gt;, and other &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WALK BENEATH WAVES&lt;/strong&gt;, name engraved in fuller. He is a &lt;strong&gt;+1 heavy&lt;/strong&gt; bohrschwert (&lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt;, treat all &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;) of mithril, with snakeskin-bound hilt, square guard, and filigreed blade. Grounds out lightning within &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, which can be hazardous to the wielder.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MISSING MY POMMEL&lt;/strong&gt;, name etched into haft. She is a &lt;strong&gt;+0 heavy&lt;/strong&gt; glaive (&lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; reach) of brazen copper, with oversized guard and large turquoise at base of blade. Cutting power reaches beyond blade; &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; range when slashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1d6-normal-swords-or-1d3-if-youre-small&#34;&gt;1d6 Normal Swords (or 1d3 if you&amp;rsquo;re Small) &lt;a href=&#34;#1d6-normal-swords-or-1d3-if-youre-small&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short sword (&lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapon, &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single-edged sword (&lt;strong&gt;medium&lt;/strong&gt; weapon,** 1d8** damage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Double-edged sword (&lt;strong&gt;medium&lt;/strong&gt; weapon,** 1d8** damage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-handed sword (&lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; weapon, &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pole-sword (&lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; weapon, &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt; damage, &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; reach)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edgeless sword (&lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; weapon, &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt; damage, treat all &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LLAgUfoxFuk/YOIHd75TiSI/AAAAAAAAuHs/jX9nuXIQSmQc1HwN7RQdZG8l7lGVxQ2pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s863/Minors%252BCups%252B07.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LLAgUfoxFuk/YOIHd75TiSI/AAAAAAAAuHs/jX9nuXIQSmQc1HwN7RQdZG8l7lGVxQ2pgCLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h640/Minors%252BCups%252B07.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seven of Cups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;archetype-bottle-witch&#34;&gt;Archetype: Bottle Witch &lt;a href=&#34;#archetype-bottle-witch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The drunk who waves his bottle, saying, it’s mine, I bought it with the money from my wages (paid by private or State institutions), while he is a victim of the Capital form, is also a usufructuary traitor to the health of the species. And so is the idiot who smokes cigarettes! Such “property” will be eliminated from the higher organization of society.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, also, is intended as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;ghost&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;ghost-bottle&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;strong&gt;empty ghost-bottle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;priming reagents&lt;/strong&gt; for ghost-bottles, a &lt;strong&gt;shovel&lt;/strong&gt;, a **prybar,**&lt;strong&gt;dark clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;waterskin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;3 days trail rations&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;bullseye lantern&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flint&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;oil&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;soft boots&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits: You can prepare &lt;strong&gt;ghost-bottles&lt;/strong&gt;, and use them with less risk than anyone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks: Those who care about the final fate of their souls will be naturally wary of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ghost-bottles&#34;&gt;Ghost-Bottles &lt;a href=&#34;#ghost-bottles&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priming a ghost-bottle for use requires an empty ghost-bottle and one hour of focused work with access to open flame and simple reagents (lead, antimony, rock salt, water, bitter nightshade, and a bit of blood).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ghost-bottles take up &lt;strong&gt;1/3&lt;/strong&gt; inventory slot each. The priming reagents take up &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; slot in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once primed, a ghost-bottle may be used to capture &lt;strong&gt;dying souls&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ghosts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;demons&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;elementals&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; if opened toward them at exactly the right moment. For most people this would take some combination of a &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; check (to get the timing right) and an opposed &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; roll (to overpower the ghost), but the first isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem for bottle witches as long as they&amp;rsquo;re prepared and the second isn&amp;rsquo;t a problem as long as they&amp;rsquo;re not trying to catch an emperor or an archdemon etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once captured, a &lt;strong&gt;bottle-ghost&lt;/strong&gt; may be used in one of several ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;drink&lt;/strong&gt; it. This kills the bottle-ghost, heals you, will probably have other effects, and is rightly seen by all intelligent creatures as an &lt;em&gt;incredibly&lt;/em&gt; evil act.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can &lt;strong&gt;let it go&lt;/strong&gt; for good. This empties the ghost-bottle, so you can prime it to capture another ghost.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can send it to &lt;strong&gt;scout&lt;/strong&gt; a nearby area. This takes &lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, after which the ghost will return to its bottle with &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; pieces of information. Ghosts are best at sensing spellcasters, powerful magic, and other spiritual beings, and very bad at sensing architecture and mundane items—and will return information in approximately this order. This is usually safe, unless something that can both see and affect ghosts is in the area to be scouted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can send it to &lt;strong&gt;haunt&lt;/strong&gt; a creature. The ghost and its target roll opposed &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt;—if the ghost wins, it imposes a penalty equal to its &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; on all actions the target takes. Should the target die while being haunted, the ghost will attempt to &lt;strong&gt;possess&lt;/strong&gt; it (as below)—if the ghost fails, it &lt;strong&gt;dissipates permanently&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can attempt to have it &lt;strong&gt;possess&lt;/strong&gt; something. The ghost and its target roll opposed &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt;—if the ghost wins, it now controls the target&amp;rsquo;s actions. If the target is of equal &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; to the ghost or better, the target may try again each round until successful—at which point the ghost &lt;strong&gt;dissipates&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;permanently&lt;/strong&gt;. Ghosts possessing a body are under no obligation to their bottle-witch and may be hostile, particularly if recently captured. Inanimate or unconscious targets don&amp;rsquo;t get to save.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it can do &lt;strong&gt;something else&lt;/strong&gt;, depending on who it is. These additional abilities—active ones—are only usable once per &amp;lsquo;scene&amp;rsquo; or so; a ghost needs time to rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these are technically possible for non-bottle-witches to accomplish, but much riskier and likely to result in the ghost dissipating permanently regardless of outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1d20-startingbottle-ghosts&#34;&gt;1d20 Starting Bottle-Ghosts &lt;a href=&#34;#1d20-startingbottle-ghosts&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skilled Sailor, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Has a little ship in the bottle with him.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Great-Grandparent, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Knows your family history. &lt;strong&gt;+1 INT.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Really Annoying Bard, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Counts as &lt;strong&gt;2 HD&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;haunting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hungry Poacher&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Also notes all animals when &lt;strong&gt;scouting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cheating Gambler, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Can rig games of chance in your favor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Opium Scholar, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Spins elaborate false histories. &lt;strong&gt;+2 INT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Obsessed Locksmith, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Can pick locks for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paranoid Apprentice, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Passively senses the presence or absence of wizards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aggressive Goat, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Can shove man-sized or smaller creatures &lt;strong&gt;5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anchorite Scribe, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Is literate, can read to you. &lt;strong&gt;+3 INT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Primitive &amp;ldquo;Botanist&amp;rdquo;, 1 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Knows which mushrooms and berries will make you shit blood.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mountain Lion, 2 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Makes incredibly realistic mountain lion noises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Old Soldier, 2 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Also notes arms and armor when &lt;strong&gt;scouting&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Loyal Ox, 2 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Can move unattended ox-portable object up to &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ancient Sword Master, 4 HD&lt;/strong&gt;—Refuses to &lt;strong&gt;haunt&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;scout&lt;/strong&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s beneath her.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eight of Cups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;archetype-mask-witch&#34;&gt;Archetype: Mask Witch &lt;a href=&#34;#archetype-mask-witch&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some students do not realize the true man in a mask&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Because they recognize ego-soul.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ego-soul is the seed of birth and death,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;And foolish people call it the true man.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, also also, is intended as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thief&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; archetype.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;corpse-mask&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;regular mask&lt;/strong&gt;, three very sharp &lt;strong&gt;knives&lt;/strong&gt; in various sizes, a formidable &lt;strong&gt;sewing kit&lt;/strong&gt;,a bottle of &lt;strong&gt;formaldehyde&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dark clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;waterskin&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;3 days trail rations&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;bullseye lantern&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;flint&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;oil&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;soft boots&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits: You can prepare &lt;strong&gt;corpse-masks&lt;/strong&gt;, and wear them to gain strange powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks: Those who care about the final fate of their bodies will be naturally wary of you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;corpse-masks&#34;&gt;Corpse-Masks &lt;a href=&#34;#corpse-masks&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Someone who knows how (that&amp;rsquo;s you) can make a death mask out of someone&amp;rsquo;s face with the aid of a good sewing kit and a wood or bone frame in, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, about an hour, maybe longer if they&amp;rsquo;ve got a significantly different sized head. Someone who knows how (also you) can gain certain powers or abilities from wearing said mask. These two skills do not ordinarily coreside in the same person. That makes you special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bare minimum effect for a corpse-mask is &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; to the highest stat of the corpse it was made from, while you wear it. More often, they&amp;rsquo;ll give you a weird little passive ability instead. Exceptionally powerful corpse-masks may even have &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; effect when worn by a non-mask-witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Masks take up &lt;strong&gt;1/3&lt;/strong&gt; slot each, and the sewing kit is another &lt;strong&gt;1/3&lt;/strong&gt;. Switching between masks takes at least an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;, even if you&amp;rsquo;ve got them all handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dancer&lt;/strong&gt;—Gain &lt;strong&gt;+1 DEX&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giant Raven&lt;/strong&gt;—Gain &lt;strong&gt;+1 INT&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beautiful Child&lt;/strong&gt;—Gain &lt;strong&gt;+1 CHA&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crone&lt;/strong&gt;—Gain &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; at &lt;strong&gt;divining&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;botany&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;midwifery&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giant Owl&lt;/strong&gt;—Can do the &lt;strong&gt;spooky head thing&lt;/strong&gt;, and see just fine in starlight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wolf&lt;/strong&gt;—Gain a bite attack for &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage, double that against creatures that speak a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;civilized tongue&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Arqot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bear&lt;/strong&gt;—Gain &lt;strong&gt;+2 STR&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giant Buzzard&lt;/strong&gt;—Can eat carrion with no risk or displeasure.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devil&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JdaAao3gf7I/YOIHdwHyOqI/AAAAAAAAuHk/9aYgY3oFd6Q76iduPIfaQtm1POfmKW8LACLcBGAsYHQ/s863/Minors%252BPentacles%252BKnight.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-JdaAao3gf7I/YOIHdwHyOqI/AAAAAAAAuHk/9aYgY3oFd6Q76iduPIfaQtm1POfmKW8LACLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h640/Minors%252BPentacles%252BKnight.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knight of Disks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;archetype-gutter-knight&#34;&gt;Archetype: Gutter Knight &lt;a href=&#34;#archetype-gutter-knight&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_The ancient kings secured good government of their kingdoms through learning of honor, of humility, of virtue, and by acting charitably to those lesser than they. _&lt;em&gt;It is the duty of every great knight, to find a quest in life, and brave the demons of the age.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not a thief archetype. It&amp;rsquo;s not even really a false witch. Certainly nobody is calling gutter knights witches and running them out of town. Quite the opposite, in fact. This is intended as an archetype of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html&#34;&gt;Ultimate Fighter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutter knights are a part of the noble caste of the civilized world, scions of great houses of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-9th-orcs-river-and-otherwise.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;River Kingdoms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-3rd-goblins-of-civilized-lands.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charter Nations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. They journey and commit acts of conspicuous heroism as a coming-of-age ritual, before eventually hanging up their cloak and returning to take their place in the gentry; theoretically humbled and made wiser by their experience. In practice few venture far from home, but some—more dedicated or naive than most, or attempting to distinguish themselves from their siblings—do wind up on the shores of the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no moth elf nobility, but some individuals have taken up the tradition nonetheless—their blades rusted and crudely made, their armor unpolished, their quilted favor-cloaks bedraggled, tattered and nearly bare, and their actions unbound by the centuries of tradition that weigh heavily on other gutter knights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;signet ring&lt;/strong&gt;and&lt;strong&gt;sealing wax&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; steel &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;odachi&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;zhanmadao&lt;/strong&gt;, a masterfully crafted** plate cuirass****,**an &lt;strong&gt;ostentatious formal outfit&lt;/strong&gt;, a set of &lt;strong&gt;well-crafted traveling clothes&lt;/strong&gt;, a fine &lt;strong&gt;tabard&lt;/strong&gt;,  &lt;strong&gt;silk pyjamas&lt;/strong&gt;, your &lt;strong&gt;quilted favor-cloak&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;single patch-favor&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;jewelry&lt;/strong&gt; worth &lt;strong&gt;300 sp&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;strong&gt;astrolabe&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;sextant&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;spyglass&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;compass&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;map&lt;/strong&gt; each in their own carrying case, and &lt;strong&gt;no food or water&lt;/strong&gt;. Moth elf &amp;ldquo;gutter knights&amp;rdquo; have regular equipment instead, besides the favor-cloak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits: You can carry and use &lt;strong&gt;patch-favors&lt;/strong&gt;, tokens of magical appreciation for your errantry. Unless you are a moth elf, you may rely on your &lt;strong&gt;family name&lt;/strong&gt; to secure respect, food, lodging, and &lt;strong&gt;knightly quests&lt;/strong&gt; in any settlement large enough to have a mayor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawbacks: You are not permitted to carry &lt;strong&gt;any currency&lt;/strong&gt; nor possess &lt;strong&gt;any items not carried by you personally&lt;/strong&gt; with the exception of a mount, saddle, and riding tack. Unless you are a moth elf, you may not strike a &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;surrendered&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;helpless&lt;/strong&gt; humanoid foe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;patch-favors&#34;&gt;Patch-Favors &lt;a href=&#34;#patch-favors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;A patch-favor is a little scrap of canvas, linen, or burlap, painted or embroidered with a token. They are traditionally granted to gutter knights for the completion of &lt;strong&gt;knightly quests&lt;/strong&gt;, but if there&amp;rsquo;s nobody around capable or willing of creating one the gutter knight is permitted to make their own to commemorate a particularly noble deed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patch-favors take an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt; to pull from one&amp;rsquo;s quilted favor-cloak and slap on something within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach. They require contact with both the gutter knight and their intended target to activate, so you can&amp;rsquo;t put them on sticks or arrows and using them on unwilling targets is an** attack** made against &lt;strong&gt;AC 10&lt;/strong&gt;. Each patch-favor can be used &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt; per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This power allegedly comes from deals struck between noble bloodlines and fey courts in ages long-past, and patch-favors do not function in the hands of anyone but a gutter knight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1d12-starting-patch-favors&#34;&gt;1d12 Starting Patch-Favors &lt;a href=&#34;#1d12-starting-patch-favors&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torch&lt;/strong&gt;—For rescuing a peasant boy from a cave. Sets something on fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper Soldier&lt;/strong&gt;—For defending a library from book-burners. &lt;strong&gt;Grapples&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;+5 STR&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mighty Oak&lt;/strong&gt;—For saving a dryad&amp;rsquo;s grove from loggers. Makes a very large tree very fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick Rope&lt;/strong&gt;—For rescuing a street performer from the gallows. Creates &lt;strong&gt;50&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; of animate rope that obeys your commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scarf&lt;/strong&gt;—For seeking out a magical yarn for a tailor. Allows the target to ignore inclement weather for &lt;strong&gt;24&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;hours&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windmill&lt;/strong&gt;—For putting out a village fire. Blows away anything not securely anchored to the ground.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bathtub&lt;/strong&gt;—For running a pervert out of a brothel. Cleans target and gives it a delicate scent of flowers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandage&lt;/strong&gt;—For binding the wounds of a wartime casualty. Heals &lt;strong&gt;2d8&lt;/strong&gt; HP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragon Scale&lt;/strong&gt;—For driving a pack of kobold raiders away from a monastery. Renders the target immune to fire for &lt;strong&gt;1 hour&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rose&lt;/strong&gt;—For chasing off the unwanted suitor of a handmaiden. Creates a thorned thicket covering five contiguous &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; squares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lance&lt;/strong&gt;—For slaying an ogre. Deals &lt;strong&gt;4d8&lt;/strong&gt; damage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conch&lt;/strong&gt;—For cutting a nymph free of a fishing net. Summons &lt;strong&gt;1d20&lt;/strong&gt; friendly sealions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Something Wicked This Way Comes (Class: Witch)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/07/something-wicked-this-way-comes-class.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 03 Jul 2021 22:22:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/07/something-wicked-this-way-comes-class.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Alright, buckle the fuck up, this is a long one. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a simplified &lt;strong&gt;classis&lt;/strong&gt;, like the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html&#34;&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html&#34;&gt;Thief&lt;/a&gt;. This is a whole-ass Witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A real one, in case you were wondering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZlbYnBh3vAA/YMZswr_mVtI/AAAAAAAAt0g/077Nc1Fucm0JWgG1Mgj4JfLcsoMkeM6MACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ZlbYnBh3vAA/YMZswr_mVtI/AAAAAAAAt0g/077Nc1Fucm0JWgG1Mgj4JfLcsoMkeM6MACLcBGAsYHQ/w373-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Five of Cups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-witch-true&#34;&gt;Class: Witch (True) &lt;a href=&#34;#class-witch-true&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witches are dark creatures born to followers of the Old Ways who have consorted with spirits, monsters, or beasts. More monster than man, they are an object of both fear and awe. Witches across the old world are regularly abandoned or exiled, so naturally many of them find their way to the Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are at least four kinds of witch—categorized by the form which their &lt;strong&gt;familiar&lt;/strong&gt; takes—but all share certain traits and abilities. Most important among these is the ability to perceive, communicate with, and command &lt;strong&gt;demons&lt;/strong&gt; through the use of &lt;strong&gt;Maleficent Dice,&lt;/strong&gt; a process that functions exactly identical to that for casting &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;Magic Dice.&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;re playing in a system with &lt;strong&gt;proficiency,&lt;/strong&gt; you have it in staves, knives, scythes, and sickles. If you&amp;rsquo;re a &lt;strong&gt;gun witch,&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re also &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with all types of &lt;strong&gt;firearm.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Herbalism &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Divining &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Theatrics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Peasant clothing, a &lt;strong&gt;satchel&lt;/strong&gt;, a skin of &lt;strong&gt;water&lt;/strong&gt;, a skin of &lt;strong&gt;wine&lt;/strong&gt;, a flint &lt;strong&gt;fire-striker&lt;/strong&gt;, 10 &lt;strong&gt;candles&lt;/strong&gt;, 3 rations of &lt;strong&gt;jerky&lt;/strong&gt;, your choice of a golden &lt;strong&gt;sickle&lt;/strong&gt; or jeweled &lt;strong&gt;kris&lt;/strong&gt; (each a &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapon), one &lt;strong&gt;witching tool&lt;/strong&gt; from the list at the end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a &lt;strong&gt;gun witch&lt;/strong&gt;, you also start with 10 witch-bullets and a powderhorn containing 10 doses of witch-powder. They&amp;rsquo;re actually normal bullets and powder, but you&amp;rsquo;re a witch. 1 slot each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Flawed, Familiar, Black Magic, 1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Trophy Casting, +1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Improved Familiar, +1 MD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Witch&amp;rsquo;s Curse, +1 MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A: Flawed &lt;br&gt;
**While directly exposed to the object of your &lt;strong&gt;supernatural weakness&lt;/strong&gt;, you experience extreme pain and revulsion and suffer &lt;strong&gt;-2 to all rolls&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;1 damage per round&lt;/strong&gt; as your form visibly rots, burns, or melts away (whichever effects your &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt; feels are appropriate). You can take measures to protect yourself; for example a weakness to sunlight can be minimized with voluminous clothing and a parasol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good weaknesses include but are not limited to: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunlight and depictions of the sun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Precious metals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ferrous metals&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melodies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own reflection&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Expressions of strong emotion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dogs, horses, and whales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Running water&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Oil&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepared food and cut stone&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Familiar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a witch, you have the ability to &lt;strong&gt;separate and externalize a piece of yourself&lt;/strong&gt; in the form of a familiar. This takes &lt;strong&gt;10 minutes of concentration&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;1d6 HP&lt;/strong&gt; each time you do it. If destroyed or separated from you, your familiars melt into a mess of blood and keratin over the next &lt;strong&gt;4 days&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What form your familiar takes determines what sort of witch you are, or perhaps the other way around. You have four options:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gun Witch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a gun witch, your familiars are &lt;strong&gt;witch-guns&lt;/strong&gt;, up to &lt;strong&gt;[templates] * 2 firearms&lt;/strong&gt;. They can be created as any firearm weapon, but require ammunition and powder as normal; deal &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; damage regardless of form; and will not fire when wielded by anyone other than you. You are fluent in a dialect of &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;Artifice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; spoken only by firearms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At template &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;when you gain &lt;strong&gt;Improved Familiar&lt;/strong&gt;, your witch-guns deal &lt;strong&gt;2d8&lt;/strong&gt; damage and gain the ability to move and manipulate themselves while remaining within your arms&amp;rsquo; reach. Gun witches who have attained this power are surrounded in combat by a whirling maelstrom of guns and ammo, plucking them from the air in a dance of death before releasing them, empty, to be reloaded by the cross-currents; while stylish, this is a horrifically inefficient way of reloading a firearm and takes &lt;strong&gt;twice as long&lt;/strong&gt; as normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Bug Witch&lt;br&gt;
**As a bug witch, your familiars are &lt;strong&gt;witch-hives&lt;/strong&gt;, up to **[templates] * 2 swarms of vermin **that move at your command. They can be whatever type or types of bug you want, and you can fit them all inside yourself and/or your clothes if you want, which is just horrid. You are fluent in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;Skittering&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a language common to all arthropods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BUGWITCH SWARM STATS (EACH)&lt;br&gt;
HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1&lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; 5&amp;rsquo; square &lt;strong&gt;Immune&lt;/strong&gt; non-area-of-effect damage&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;/strong&gt; Deals &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage per round to everything other than you within its area that is vulnerable to being eaten by bugs (most things), without an &lt;strong&gt;attack roll&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; or any of that nonsense. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t stack because, uh, there&amp;rsquo;s only enough room for so many bugs to eat something at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At template &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; when you gain &lt;strong&gt;Improved Familiar&lt;/strong&gt;, your witch-hives are imbued with preternatural strength, allowing them to carry you (or anything else, though they&amp;rsquo;ll still be eating it while they do so) up any surface that a bug could climb; or buoy you slowly aloft on thousands of diaphanous wings at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; per round. They can only do this for a few minutes at most—you can&amp;rsquo;t fly overland on bugwings. Unwilling bugluggage may make a &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; save to avoid being bugnapped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Friend Witch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a friend witch, your familiar is a &lt;strong&gt;witch-tulpa&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as a &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;. Unlike most familiars, this isn&amp;rsquo;t so much a piece of your soul externalized into a physical form as it is merely separated from the rest of your selfhood and sequestered within. While carrying a &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;, you gain their &lt;strong&gt;visible traits&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;restriction&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;first boon&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Having friends is a bit complicated, so there&amp;rsquo;s a section downbelow (under the spells and mishaps and dooms and such) that details how that works.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At template &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;when you gain &lt;strong&gt;Improved Familiar&lt;/strong&gt;, you achieve complete (dis)unity with your &lt;strong&gt;friends&lt;/strong&gt;, gaining the &lt;strong&gt;second boon&lt;/strong&gt; of any &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt; that you carry as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cancer Witch&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a cancer witch, your familiar is a &lt;strong&gt;witch-tumor&lt;/strong&gt; which (ha, a-ha) quarantines within itself and protects you from the effects of any &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/plagues-and-poxes.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;diseases or other maladies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that you contract. You may choose to pass or fail &lt;strong&gt;saves&lt;/strong&gt; against such maladies when you encounter them, and are able to secrete &lt;strong&gt;diseased blood&lt;/strong&gt; from your palms which causes any who contact it to &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; against transmission of any maladies thus contained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are ever subject to an effect that &lt;strong&gt;cures diseases&lt;/strong&gt;, your witch-tumor dies along with any maladies contained within it and you must create a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At template &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt;when you gain &lt;strong&gt;Improved Familiar&lt;/strong&gt;, you gain the ability to spray a torrent of &lt;strong&gt;diseased blood&lt;/strong&gt; from your palms like a really gross firehose. This costs you &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt; each time you do it, and reaches, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, at least &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; straight up or up to &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in a horizontal arc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Black Magic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are familiar with two &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; from the list way downbelow. One is the &lt;strong&gt;demon&lt;/strong&gt; known as &lt;em&gt;Evil Eye&lt;/em&gt;, and the other is determined by rolling &lt;strong&gt;1d20&lt;/strong&gt;. Each time you gain another template of Witch, roll once to attract a new &lt;strong&gt;spell&lt;/strong&gt;—if you roll a result you already possess, choose the next &lt;strong&gt;spell&lt;/strong&gt; above or below it that you don&amp;rsquo;t already have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Trophy Casting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have developed methods of enhancing your power and protecting yourself from the hazards of spellcasting, using your blood and &lt;strong&gt;trophies&lt;/strong&gt; with significance to the &lt;strong&gt;Old Ways&lt;/strong&gt; as fuel. You can voluntarily change any number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; to show a &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; after rolling them, allowing you to avoid chaos or doom, at the cost of consuming a &lt;strong&gt;trophy&lt;/strong&gt; and taking &lt;strong&gt;damage equal to the original die result&lt;/strong&gt; for each &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; to be changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of &lt;strong&gt;trophies&lt;/strong&gt; include: &lt;strong&gt;snake skeletons&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;wolf hearts&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;shark jawbones&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;jars of ash from the corpses of sentient creatures that burned to death&lt;/strong&gt;. Only one &lt;strong&gt;trophy&lt;/strong&gt; may be produced from each corpse, and a corpse must be at least of small size to produce a &lt;strong&gt;trophy&lt;/strong&gt;. A &lt;strong&gt;trophy&lt;/strong&gt; takes up &lt;strong&gt;1/3&lt;/strong&gt; of an inventory slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Witch&amp;rsquo;s Curse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a powerful witch such as yourself pronounces a &lt;strong&gt;curse&lt;/strong&gt;, the universe takes notice. In order for this to work properly you must have been legitimately (in your eyes, and those of the &lt;strong&gt;DM&lt;/strong&gt;) wronged by your victim-to-be, otherwise you can just curse them with &lt;em&gt;Evil Eye&lt;/em&gt; like a lesser witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, tales of your exploits and magical potency have by now reached the Civilized Lands and caused folk there to Take Notice. Expect an &lt;strong&gt;apprentice warlock&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;furious witch-hunters&lt;/strong&gt; to arrive on the next ship—if they aren&amp;rsquo;t here already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gKywKTnIGFU/YI2R3ZHj14I/AAAAAAAAsJM/9zGVqN1sJ0ITI5PSnh0z_N6zioJPAAFDQCLcBGAsYHQ/16-clarke-faust_900.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gKywKTnIGFU/YI2R3ZHj14I/AAAAAAAAsJM/9zGVqN1sJ0ITI5PSnh0z_N6zioJPAAFDQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h549/16-clarke-faust_900.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;witch-magic&#34;&gt;Witch Magic &lt;a href=&#34;#witch-magic&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a &lt;strong&gt;spellcaster&lt;/strong&gt;, you are able to perceive and communicate with the spirits known commonly as &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;. As a &lt;strong&gt;witch&lt;/strong&gt;, those available to &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; to command (by means of your &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;) are technically termed &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/12/de-luminare-minus-caelestis-hierarchia.html&#34;&gt;demons&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, also known as &lt;strong&gt;elementals&lt;/strong&gt;, though this system of classification is somewhat tautological. Alas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; may exist, and you may be able to bribe, coerce, or otherwise convince them to join you. By the same token, experienced witches and such met in the wild may travel with &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; outside this list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Evil Eye&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A hunched form with a single large eye and pointed ears; or are they horns? Their material appearance varies significantly between instances&lt;/em&gt;_—plant matter, stone, raw flesh&amp;hellip;_&lt;br&gt;
The first &lt;strong&gt;demon&lt;/strong&gt; any witch becomes familiar (ha, aha) with. He may be ordered to harass a target, tweaking their ears and tying their shoelaces together and generally being a nuisance until given a new order. If it matters, he can exert up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; pounds of force at a time during this duration. Owing to his simple-minded and generally servile nature, he is easy to bribe or goad (using &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;) into performing tasks outside his usual repertoire—_nearly _all of which he is wildly incompetent at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is a mass of red ribbons, stretched across every available space. She &amp;lsquo;speaks&amp;rsquo; seldom, and softly when she does.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While you concentrate, &lt;em&gt;Hand&lt;/em&gt; can lift and move objects within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw gently at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; per round, or hurl them up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; dealing &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage to them and anything they impact with a &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half. If used to crush, tear, etc, she deals **[sum] **damage per round. She cannot affect targets that pass a &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; save (or have one passed by their holder/wielder/wearer/etc), and is limited to targets of approximate mass relative to the number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - a handheld object or small animal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - a person plus gear&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - a horse or monitor plus rider and saddlebags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - a fully laden wagon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - a small house plus inhabitants and furniture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mend&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is grey-skinned and sullen, wearing something that looks like tradesman&amp;rsquo;s leathers. Can be roused to enthusiasm by detailed engineering discussions.&lt;br&gt;
Mend&lt;/em&gt; patches holes, welds breaks, and otherwise repairs the touched object instantly, healing up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum] + [dice]&lt;/strong&gt; HP to it if it has HP or fixing any amount of damage short of complete destruction if it does not. If an object &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; been completely destroyed, &lt;em&gt;Mend&lt;/em&gt; may still be able to reconstitute it depending on its complexity and the number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in him:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; MD** - simple shapes, blocks of material**&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - boats, wagons, bridges, most weapons and armor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - artworks, siege engines, sailing vessels, complex architecture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - clockworks, repeating firearms, steam engines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - most corpses (though &lt;em&gt;Mend&lt;/em&gt; cannot restore life), most electrical devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;6&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shatter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is boldly colored and somewhat crudely formed, as if pieced together from scrap clay by an inexpert sculptor. Over-fond of complex plans and mechanisms. Thinks she&amp;rsquo;s smarter than she is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In order to command &lt;em&gt;Shatter,&lt;/em&gt; her name must be shouted; not merely spoken. She does exactly what her name suggests to any target within shouting distance, and is capable of wreaking an amount of destruction relative to the &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - A few blows with a hammer (A handheld object, an artwork)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Two folks with tools (A door, a chest, a sarcophagus)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - A half-dozen tradesfolk with block and tackle (A tunnel, a wooden building, an architectural feature)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - A dozen tradesfolk with heavy equipment (A stone building or fortification, a large cavern)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;8&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enlarge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is blue-skinned, elephant-headed, enormous. Refuses to believe problems can be solved by any means other than physical force.&lt;br&gt;
Enlarge&lt;/em&gt; doubles the size of the touched target &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; times for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. If the target is a creature, it gets &lt;strong&gt;+2 STR&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;-2 DEX&lt;/strong&gt; for each time it is doubled, and anything worn or carried by it likewise increases in size. For each time size is doubled, weight quadruples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reduce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is red-skinned, bull-headed, &lt;em&gt;enormous&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Refuses to believe problems can be solved by any means other than physical force.&lt;br&gt;
_Reduce halves the size of the touched target &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; times for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. If the target is a creature, it gets &lt;strong&gt;-2 STR&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;+2 DEX&lt;/strong&gt; for each time it is halved, and anything worn or carried by it likewise decreases in size. For each time size is halved, weight is quartered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_Wears a linen robe, clinical, detached, omits names and pronouns when speaking. _&lt;em&gt;Seen it all before, twice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Heals the touched target for &lt;strong&gt;[sum] + [dice]&lt;/strong&gt; HP. Alternatively, can be directed to solve specific problems depending on the &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD -&lt;/strong&gt; No alternatives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Mend broken bones or other long-term wounds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Cure a malady such as disease or poison.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Reattach recently severed limbs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - Regrow missing limbs or organs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;12&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Inflict&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is a crying youth with six many-jointed arms. Two cover his face, two hug his body, and two wield straight razors in furious slashing arcs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Inflict&lt;/em&gt; cuts a given target within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw for &lt;strong&gt;[sum] + [dice]&lt;/strong&gt; damage. He refuses to be directed against inanimate objects specifically, or ones which don&amp;rsquo;t appear to bleed or feel pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Illusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is long-haired and vain and aristocratic, pouts if formed into something ugly and preens if formed into something beautiful. His aesthetic sensibilities are focused on bright, clashing colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Illusion&lt;/em&gt; shapes himself into an object or creature up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; in diameter, which appears completely real and moves however you desire but produces no sound, smell, touch, heat, etc. Shaping &lt;em&gt;Illusion&lt;/em&gt; into a detailed copy of an existing object or creature requires either close familiarity or a reference to work from. Creatures inspecting &lt;em&gt;Illusion&lt;/em&gt; closely may roll &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; to determine his true nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Darkness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is a three-meter-long grub, black and shiny and dimly transparent. Clumsy, sleeps more than he&amp;rsquo;s awake.&lt;br&gt;
Darkness&lt;/em&gt; attaches himself to the touched target and radiates a cloud of absolute magical darkness in a &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; radius. Non-magical sight within or through the radius is completely impossible. He can maintain this effect for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours when attached to an inanimate, unattended, or willing target, or &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds if attached to an unwilling one that succeeds a &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Invisibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is faceless, wearing a dark business suit. She chatters with the neurotic, anxious edge of an inferiority complex, especially when performing a task.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Invisibility&lt;/em&gt; submerges the target partway into the ethereal plane for up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * [sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes, rendering them completely invisible to normal sight and able to see other invisible creatures and objects. If cast with &lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt;, she hides the target from supernatural vision of non-invisible creatures as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrying&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;It has a boxy, geometrically shaped head and a large, hooded eye. Below the neck, it disappears into a mess of black-feathered wings and a single, large crow&amp;rsquo;s foot.&lt;br&gt;
Scrying&lt;/em&gt; will allow you to perceive through its eye at will, and can be directed to seek out any target that you know the name of and could identify in a lineup of similar targets regardless of line-of-sight or range, which it will watch for up to &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; * &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours.If it matters, it flies about as fast as a commercial airliner. For each &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in it beyond the first, you may have it perform one additional task from this list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relay sound to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relay touch, taste, and smell to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allow you to speak through it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alert you under specific conditions even if you&amp;rsquo;re not paying attention (or sleeping).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;18&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He wears a jumpsuit or coverall, and has four many-jointed arms tipped with jagged steel spines. He is a creep, a voyeur, a kleptomaniac, and argues vociferously for you to fulfill his desires.&lt;br&gt;
Opens&lt;/em&gt; a target within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw. &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/01/osr-orthodox-wizards.html&#34;&gt;Doors are flung wide, shackles bent open, belts come undone.&lt;/a&gt; The occupants of armor, clothing, mecha, etc. are expelled. If the target is secured, attended, or sapient, &lt;em&gt;Open&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;[dice] level&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;+[best] STR&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;skilled&lt;/strong&gt; at opening things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hold&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is a sinister figure in white, blindfolded, bound in chains and one of those funny jackets that won&amp;rsquo;t let you check your wristwatch. She speaks in a piercing, imperious voice.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Closes and locks (if applicable; doors slam shut, drawbridges slam up, half-drawn swords slam back in their scabbards) a target within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw, then &lt;em&gt;Holds&lt;/em&gt; it in place for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds. If the target is secured, attended, or sapient, &lt;em&gt;Hold&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;[dice] level&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;+[best] STR&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;skilled&lt;/strong&gt; at wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://scryfall.com/card/brb/87/terror&#34;&gt;Terror&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is an emaciated figure, contorted into a fetal position with wild eyes and every muscle tensed. He is terrified of everything, for absolutely &lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;blisteringly incoherent and conspiratorial reasons. If asked to elaborate on a given phobia, he has a&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; chance of being (in some small part) correct in his fears.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Emanates a burst of psychic &lt;em&gt;Terror&lt;/em&gt;, causing up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; targets of &lt;strong&gt;[dice] HD&lt;/strong&gt; or less to roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; or flee your presence for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds. If unable to flee, targets that fail their saves cower unresponsively for the duration. Targets that succeed their saves or remain in your presence beyond his duration are &lt;strong&gt;shaken&lt;/strong&gt;, and suffer a &lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt; penalty to everything until they are able to escape you and take a minute to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sleep&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is a twitching, aberrant wreck, paranoid shivers and sharp edges cast in polished steel and white glass. He abhors violence and&lt;/em&gt; will &lt;em&gt;wake his targets by shrieking if you plot to execute them.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Causes up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; targets of &lt;strong&gt;[dice] HD&lt;/strong&gt; or less to roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; or fall into a deep, coma-like sleep for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, from which they can only be awoken by vigorous slapping/shaking (which takes an action from someone nearby) or damage, and during which they do not require any food or water. Surprised targets automatically fail their saves, and if cast on a single target with more than one &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; his effects are permanent until awakened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fog&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is a pile of cyan-stained rags and linens that only vaguely resembles a humanoid form. A diffuse, pale glow emanates from where his face would be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A huge quantity of black &lt;em&gt;Fog&lt;/em&gt; pours forth from your mouth and nose, spreading to cover a &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; radius for up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours, or &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes in bright sunlight or strong wind. The density and effects of the fog vary with the number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The fog is sufficient to obscure details (faces, etc) and apply &lt;strong&gt;disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt; to ranged attacks made through it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The fog is sufficient to obscure objects more than &lt;strong&gt;5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; away in their entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The fogis thick enough to conceal an outstretched hand, and completely opaque to supernatural vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - The fogdeals &lt;strong&gt;[best]&lt;/strong&gt; damage to creatures other than you with every breath, and they must roll &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; each round or be struck permanently blind if it contacts their eyes directly. When commanded with this number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fog&lt;/em&gt; instead answers to the name &lt;em&gt;Cloudkill&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;24&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is an old woman, black-shrouded and mourning. Her voice carries the weight of centuries, and she teases at ancient secrets.&lt;br&gt;
Animates&lt;/em&gt; a touched corpse of **[dice] * 2 **&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; or fewer, raising it as undead. If cast with &lt;strong&gt;2 or less MD&lt;/strong&gt; the undead raised are unintelligent and will serve you unquestioningly. If cast with &lt;strong&gt;3 or more MD&lt;/strong&gt; the undead raised are intelligent, created free, and may roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to resist being brought back into the world if they desire. The specific type of undead raised depends on the number of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in her, and the ritual preparations undergone as a part of the casting:&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Skeleton&lt;/em&gt;. Requires black gemstones worth at least &lt;strong&gt;25 sp&lt;/strong&gt;, which are placed in the eye sockets of the corpse. Removing the flesh of a corpse that is not already skeletonized takes at least one hour of solid work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Zombie&lt;/em&gt;. Requires embalming and preservative agents worth at least &lt;strong&gt;50 sp&lt;/strong&gt; and one hour to properly apply them, or a corpse which has already been preserved through similar methods. Alternately, zombies can be created with no preparation or materials from a fresh corpse, but will be paralyzed by rigor mortis within &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Ghoul.&lt;/em&gt; Requires a piece of dead flesh and gnawed bone both from the corpse of a sapient creature, a pot of grave earth, a fragment of crypt or tombstone, and ten minutes to force all of the above down the target&amp;rsquo;s throat and into its stomach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Revenant.&lt;/em&gt; Requires black gemstones worth at least &lt;strong&gt;1,000 sp&lt;/strong&gt;, the bottled soul of a sapient creature, and one minute to lure the target&amp;rsquo;s soul back to their body using the above as sacrifices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Haunting&lt;/em&gt;. Requires an item of the target&amp;rsquo;s that had great personal value to them when they were alive, and six hours to carry out the necessary rituals to summon and re-bind them to their corpse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6 MD&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Lich.&lt;/em&gt; Requires uniquely powerful reagents that are &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; not for sale, and twenty four hours to conduct an elaborate ritual extracting and processing the target&amp;rsquo;s soul. &lt;em&gt;Animate Dead&lt;/em&gt; resents answering to this name, and protests its inaccuracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;ol start=&#34;26&#34;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Abjure&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He is a small child formed from blue-tinged iron, nervous and fretting with bracelets. He is lonely, friendly, and craves the company of other demons.&lt;br&gt;
Abjures&lt;/em&gt; magical effects, elementals, devils, other &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt;, the animating spirits of undead or constructs, curses, &amp;amp;c back to wherever they came from. He reduces his target&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; each by his own, completely banishing them if either is reduced to &lt;strong&gt;0&lt;/strong&gt;; use &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; in their place if it&amp;rsquo;s a target that doesn&amp;rsquo;t have those values. If commanded as a &lt;strong&gt;readied action&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Abjure&lt;/em&gt; can affect others &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; as they&amp;rsquo;re cast and before they take effect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is a devilress clad in black businesswear, her proportions slightly off when viewed from the corner of your eye. Her fingers taper to red-stained razor points, and her ever-so-slightly-too-wide grin hides a forest of needlelike teeth. She is quick to inform about the dangers of commanding her, and has release forms and waivers to be signed if you do.&lt;br&gt;
Summons&lt;/em&gt; a devil of &lt;strong&gt;[dice] HD&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;[sum] HP&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds. The devil is not in any way compelled to do your bidding unless you know its &lt;strong&gt;true name&lt;/strong&gt;, in which case it is unable to harm you and you may dismiss it at will. Commanding &lt;em&gt;Summon&lt;/em&gt; with more preparation (and signing more of her contracts and forms) allows a longer duration and more control over the devil to be summoned:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With one round of preparation (a hasty signature, a quick sigil on the ground) the summoning persists for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes and you may make one opposed &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; roll to banish the devil per round (for example, if it&amp;rsquo;s trying to kill you).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With one hour of preparation (a lengthy perusal of contracts, a well-formed summoning circle) the summoning persists for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; hours and the devil is unable to leave the summoning circle until you allow it (traditionally, after it&amp;rsquo;s agreed not to kill you).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;witching-mishaps&#34;&gt;Witching Mishaps &lt;a href=&#34;#witching-mishaps&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You contract &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/plagues-and-poxes.html&#34;&gt;Snoos&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a sort of exposure-induced allergy to magical irradiation which causes any further magical effects to &lt;strong&gt;stun&lt;/strong&gt; you into a watery-eyed sneezing fit for &lt;strong&gt;1 round&lt;/strong&gt; each. In addition, your skin gives off a faint blue glow until next dawn.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your veins turn &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-let-there-be-blood-and-also.html&#34;&gt;jet black&lt;/a&gt; beneath your skin, stiff and painful. You gain no benefit (aside from your blood returning to normal) the next time you &lt;strong&gt;rest&lt;/strong&gt;, and take &lt;strong&gt;1 damage&lt;/strong&gt; per minute exposed to **sunlight **until you do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shards of black glass explode into being around you, pelting everything within &lt;strong&gt;20&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; (including you) for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage, &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; half. Until the next dawn, any wounds you directly inflict on others are mirrored onto your own flesh.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A torrent of winged insects issues from your mouth for &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; rounds, preventing you from doing anything other than stagger around. Anyone within &lt;strong&gt;20&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; must roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; or be likewise incapacitated as they flail and swat at the choking swarm.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your mouth seals itself into a smooth expanse, preventing you from speaking or casting spells for &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. Stubby mushrooms sprout from all inanimate surfaces in a &lt;strong&gt;[dice] * 5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; radius ring.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Up to &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; nearby corpses rise from the grave and attack you with single-minded intensity, moaning and whispering your name. Plants within a **[dice] * 5&amp;rsquo; **radius wither away and will never grow there again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;witching-dooms&#34;&gt;Witching Dooms &lt;a href=&#34;#witching-dooms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Witch (ha, aha) &lt;strong&gt;doom&lt;/strong&gt; do you get? I guess it depends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doom-of-fish&#34;&gt;Doom of Fish &lt;a href=&#34;#doom-of-fish&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your eyes grow huge and milky, your flesh grey and slick. You can see in the dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your skin hardens to glimmering scales, webs grow between your extremities and your body. &lt;strong&gt;+4 AC&lt;/strong&gt;; double speed in the water, half speed on land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your lungs reshape and extrude themselves onto the surface of your skin as gills, and your limbs wither away into sleek-spined fins. You&amp;rsquo;re a fish now, can&amp;rsquo;t speak any language other than &lt;strong&gt;Hadeal&lt;/strong&gt;, and drown in open air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doom of Fish can be escaped by capturing the teeth of a &lt;strong&gt;sea monster&lt;/strong&gt; and burying them in dry land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doom-of-blood&#34;&gt;Doom of Blood &lt;a href=&#34;#doom-of-blood&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blood crusts slowly around your eyes, nostrils, other orifices. You heal &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per pint of blood you drink.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your wounds no longer close, and blood beads slowly through your skin. You no longer heal naturally from food or rest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your skin sloughs off entirely, and a torrent of blood issues perpetually from any uncovered openings in your body. You can&amp;rsquo;t speak any language other than &lt;strong&gt;Serumic&lt;/strong&gt;, and lose &lt;strong&gt;1 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per hour.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doom of Blood can be escaped by &lt;strong&gt;removing&lt;/strong&gt; all of your blood—which becomes progressively more difficult as you advance in this Doom, since it gives you more blood or you&amp;rsquo;d bleed out even faster than it already makes you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doom-of-ashes&#34;&gt;Doom of Ashes &lt;a href=&#34;#doom-of-ashes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your flesh turns black; your &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-let-there-be-blood-and-also.html&#34;&gt;blood thick, syrupy, and magnetic&lt;/a&gt;. No wound can kill you, though you still risk death—and dismemberment—by other means.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your entire body aches, and your eyes are as black as void. Absolute darkness is daylight to you, but even dim light blinds. Any spells you cast that would create light—even incidental—create magical darkness instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You fade into a charred and insubstantial shadow, rendering you unable to interact with physical objects or speak any language other than &lt;strong&gt;Ember&lt;/strong&gt;. Bright illumination destroys any part of you that it touches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doom of Ashes can be escaped by giving up an &lt;strong&gt;archdemon&lt;/strong&gt; as a burnt offering, in a ritual presided over by a priest of appropriate power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;doom-of-bones&#34;&gt;Doom of Bones &lt;a href=&#34;#doom-of-bones&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bones rattle angrily about and against each other in your presence, causing you and anything adjacent to you that possesses bones to suffer &lt;strong&gt;disadvantage&lt;/strong&gt; on any tasks requiring dexterity or quiet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Corpses which possess skeletons &lt;strong&gt;animate&lt;/strong&gt; in your presence and attack you, and even loose bones gain some level of locomotion and will do their best to harm you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your own bones rebel against you, escaping your flesh as an animate &lt;strong&gt;skeleton&lt;/strong&gt; and rendering you unable to speak or understand &lt;strong&gt;Clatter&lt;/strong&gt; if you could before, or—perhaps more importantly—move in anything approaching a useful fashion. On the upside, I guess you don&amp;rsquo;t personally suffer from your first Doom anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Doom of Bones can be escaped by replacing your (traitorous, scheming) skeleton with bones cut from a suitably impressive &lt;strong&gt;snake&lt;/strong&gt;. Some crushing and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering&#34;&gt;sintering&lt;/a&gt; may be necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wgR6ghdxYA/YMz4HbfmKxI/AAAAAAAAt3g/froDqPzuC-YxMZB7BRF6woCreiRfLB64ACLcBGAsYHQ/s900/03-clarke-faust_900.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0wgR6ghdxYA/YMz4HbfmKxI/AAAAAAAAt3g/froDqPzuC-YxMZB7BRF6woCreiRfLB64ACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h434/03-clarke-faust_900.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;witch-tulpas-also-known-as-friends&#34;&gt;Witch-Tulpas (also known as Friends) &lt;a href=&#34;#witch-tulpas-also-known-as-friends&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Summoning a &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt; works the same way as it does with other familiars (&lt;strong&gt;10 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;1d6 HP&lt;/strong&gt;, et al) but once summoned they are carried within your soul, rather than physically. If you break a breakable &lt;strong&gt;restriction&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt; you are carrying, you immediately stop carrying that **friend **and take &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage due to psychic shock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each time you gain a template of friend witch—including the first—&lt;strong&gt;roll once&lt;/strong&gt; on the list below to determine which &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt; you are able to summon. If you eat the heart of another friend witch, you gain the ability to summon any &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt; they were carrying at the time of their death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As with the spell list, this is just a list of those possible to start the game with as a friend witch and more may exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nuul Ux, the Ashen Waste&lt;br&gt;
Visible:&lt;/strong&gt; Pallid; emaciated; charred skin flakes away to reveal pink scar tissue.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Spoil food and evaporate water with a glance at up to &lt;strong&gt;60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; range.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Weapons wreathed in smoke and cinders, treat all &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; and deal fire damage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Food and drink turn to ash at a touch, granting no nourishment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Um-Yanith, the Carrion Feast&lt;br&gt;
Visible:&lt;/strong&gt; Stinking; plagued with lice and fleas; hair falling out in clumps; skin gleams sickly.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Can eat and gain nourishment from any dead flesh, immune to effects of rotten meat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Gain immunity to one spell or magical ability of any creature you eat, as long as Um-Yanith is carried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Must eat a piece of every corpse you see and have access to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Um-Sharan, the Chronicle Worm&lt;br&gt;
Visible:&lt;/strong&gt; Corpulent; veins and organs show faintly through translucent skin.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Able to read (not speak) any language, living or dead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Recover one memory from anything you consume.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Must stop to read any text you encounter in its entirety, and never interrupt a story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hexochre, the Conqueror King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Visible:&lt;/strong&gt; Smoldering embers for eyes; clothing turns to soot-black, cruelly spiked armor.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Clothes harden and transform to black steel plate (&lt;strong&gt;17 AC&lt;/strong&gt;) while Hexochre is carried.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Body gains mass and scars of a warrior hero, count as having &lt;strong&gt;+4 STR&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Must respond to insults with immediate violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phoemordia, the Drowned Queen&lt;br&gt;
Visible:&lt;/strong&gt; Blue-black eyes and lips; white skin; yellow sclera; perpetually dripping.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Point to a target within &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; of water; ghostly hands (&lt;strong&gt;+5 STR&lt;/strong&gt;) drag them in.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; If you die underwater, immediately rise as a ghoul but must carry Phoemordia forever.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Halve maximum &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt;. Followers have a &lt;strong&gt;5%&lt;/strong&gt; chance of desertion per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zoshardan, the Earthen Sword&lt;br&gt;
Visible:&lt;/strong&gt; Calloused, grey-brown skin; smell &lt;em&gt;old&lt;/em&gt;, like cave dust and wet stone.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;First Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Create spiked formations from existing stone with a gesture; &lt;strong&gt;3d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage, &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; half.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Second Boon:&lt;/strong&gt; Merge limbs with stone or earth to become immovable; works on walls and ceilings too.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Restriction:&lt;/strong&gt; Take &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; damage  per round exposed to sunlight or running water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mortar and Pestle.&lt;/strong&gt; Sort of a &amp;ldquo;travel cauldron&amp;rdquo;, a real one&amp;rsquo;s too big to haul around. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Black&amp;rdquo; Cat.&lt;/strong&gt; Actually calico, under the mascara. Fairly well-trained, as far as cats go; enough to follow you around, anyway. 1 slot, but won&amp;rsquo;t let you carry it around much.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A cursed grimoire. &lt;em&gt;Screams&lt;/em&gt; when opened, eats uncareful mice and beetles. 1/3 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An umbrella with a parrot&amp;rsquo;s-head pommel. Provides off-color commentary and cusses. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A solid gold femur. Looks human. 2 slots (heavy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never runs out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impossible to extinguish, burns underwater or in vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns hot enough to cut steel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Summons a powerful devil. Does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; allow the same sort of control &lt;em&gt;Summon&lt;/em&gt; does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>You Shall Not Steal, nor Deal Falsely, nor Lie to One Another (Class: Thief)</title>

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/06/you-shall-not-steal-nor-deal-falsely.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A Thief, in the style of my &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/03/grass-grows-birds-fly-sun-shines-and.html&#34;&gt;Fighter&lt;/a&gt;, I suppose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0klXtPS00No/YMViLB-p78I/AAAAAAAAtzk/_Lj3MkGaknUoINurLrU8y62AmwBVu_YPACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-0klXtPS00No/YMViLB-p78I/AAAAAAAAtzk/_Lj3MkGaknUoINurLrU8y62AmwBVu_YPACLcBGAsYHQ/w371-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Seven of Swords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not recognizing anyone’s right to judge me, I don’t ask for either pardon or indulgence. I don’t go begging to those I hate and hold in contempt. You are the stronger. Dispose of me as you wish; send me to a penal colony or the scaffold. I don’t care! But before going our separate ways, let me tell you one last thing:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;em&gt;The right to live isn’t begged for, it’s taken.&lt;/em&gt; **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― &lt;a href=&#34;https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/marius-jacob-why-i-was-a-burglar&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Marius Jacob&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Why I Was a Burglar&lt;/em&gt;, 1905&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class: Ultimate Thief&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every template of Thief you have gives you &lt;strong&gt;+1 to sneaking&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;stealing&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;saves&lt;/strong&gt;. Your second and fourth templates also each give you &lt;strong&gt;+1 to-hit&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re playing in a system with &lt;strong&gt;proficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, you have it in &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; armor and any type of weapon that can be both wielded in one hand and concealed under a light jacket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Stealth and &lt;strong&gt;see template A&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;knife&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;light weapon&lt;/strong&gt; of your choice and &lt;strong&gt;ammunition&lt;/strong&gt; for it if applicable, a &lt;strong&gt;thieves tool&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;dark clothing&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;bullseye lantern&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;oil&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;soft boots&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;cloak&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; Scraps, Skilled, Stolen Fortunes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Connected, Hidden Pockets, +1 Skill, +1 FD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Opportunist, +1 Skill, +1 FD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Shadow, +1 Skill, +1 FD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Scraps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A life spent eating scraps and fleeing from the cops has left you frail and sickly, giving you &lt;strong&gt;-1 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per &lt;strong&gt;HD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Skilled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A thief lives or dies by their skills, and by surviving this long you&amp;rsquo;ve already picked up a much broader repertoire than most adventurers—as well as some special tricks. &lt;strong&gt;Twice&lt;/strong&gt; upon gaining this template as well as &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt; for each thief template thereafter, gain a skill from the list downbelow. In addition, you gain the &lt;strong&gt;special ability&lt;/strong&gt; from the list for each skill on it that you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Stolen Fortunes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have a pool of &lt;strong&gt;Fortune Dice&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;FD&lt;/strong&gt;, which are &lt;strong&gt;d4&lt;/strong&gt;s equal to the number of thief templates you have. You can roll any number of these when you roll a &lt;strong&gt;d20&lt;/strong&gt;, and add them to the result. &lt;strong&gt;FD&lt;/strong&gt; that come up a result less than or equal to the number of &lt;strong&gt;FD&lt;/strong&gt; you rolled are expended until you get a good long rest, otherwise they return to your pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Connected&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whatever organization, underworld, community, or creed you belong to is connected to people and places everywhere, and there are signs by which you may recognize and be recognized as a part of the same. When you roll a natural &lt;strong&gt;7&lt;/strong&gt; on a &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt; roll, reroll it and the encounter is in some way connected to your background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Hidden Pockets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have &lt;strong&gt;[templates]&lt;/strong&gt; extra inventory slots. Items you store in them can&amp;rsquo;t be found by anyone unless you want them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Opportunist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When fighting an opponent who can&amp;rsquo;t pay full attention to you—because they&amp;rsquo;ve got sand or sun in their eyes, they&amp;rsquo;re being flanked, you yelled &amp;ldquo;hey what&amp;rsquo;s that over there&amp;rdquo; and they&amp;rsquo;re an idiot, &amp;amp;c—your attacks deal &lt;strong&gt;double&lt;/strong&gt; damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Shadow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can &lt;strong&gt;vanish&lt;/strong&gt; in shadows, do loud things (running, fighting, breaking stuff) &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; quietly, and do quiet things (walking, climbing, pulling a knife, rummaging around in a backpack) in &lt;strong&gt;absolute&lt;/strong&gt; silence. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;image stolen (ha, aha) from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.artstation.com/artwork/zAb0Ed&#34;&gt;artstation&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1d20 Thief Skills&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locksmithing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you successfully pick a lock, it&amp;rsquo;s instantaneous. When you fail, it only takes a round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jury-rigging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Improvised or makeshift tools and devices function as well as professionally made ones, in your hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climbing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can climb sheer surfaces as if they were merely difficult, even without gear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Acrobatics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can dodge over, around, and effectively &lt;em&gt;through&lt;/em&gt; people and person-scale obstacles as if they weren&amp;rsquo;t even there, as long as there&amp;rsquo;s room to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html&#34;&gt;Burglary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Given ten minutes per hundred square feet, you can pile everything vaguely saleable - including hidden objects, parts of other objects, et cetera - in the middle of a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Appraisal&lt;br&gt;
**You can determine the value of objects to within one order of magnitude at a glance, and identify them precisely with between one minute and one hour of study depending on scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forgery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can forge believable documents, signatures, et cetera without an original to examine, provided you&amp;rsquo;ve seen one before or have a halfway decent description to work from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disguise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When disguised as someone, you count &lt;em&gt;as them&lt;/em&gt; for any magical or metaphysical purposes. If it matters, you can also mimic their iris patterns, fingerprints, blood type, &amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forensics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When examining the scene of an event, you can physically &lt;em&gt;see and hear&lt;/em&gt; an approximation of how the event played out. This won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily give you any new information, but it will certainly make clues obvious that might otherwise have been missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anatomy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When presented with an unaware subject that possesses a comprehensible anatomy, you can place them in whatever state you desire with a nerve pinch/karate chop/stiff-knuckled jab to the pressure points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fast-talking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Potential interlocutors must check &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; to interrupt or disbelieve you as long as you keep talking. You can speak for a full thirty seconds without running out of breath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devices&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can alter or repair &lt;strong&gt;devices&lt;/strong&gt; effectively even without appropriate tools. When you &lt;strong&gt;sabotage&lt;/strong&gt; a device, you can choose exactly what time or condition under which it will fail and the manner in which it will do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toxicology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can determine the nature of a poisoning from symptoms without risk of error, and can formulate a reasonably effective poison or antidote from any well-stocked pantry or acre of wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Linguistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Through roguish instinct, you know how to say all of the following in any language that you&amp;rsquo;ve heard spoken even once:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t want any trouble&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;How can I get &lt;em&gt;fucked up&lt;/em&gt; around here?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I have the money, if you have the stuff&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;This is [a] robbery!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s my wife!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;COPS!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smuggling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per locale, you can have had a &lt;strong&gt;connection&lt;/strong&gt; smuggle something helpful in for you. The &lt;strong&gt;DM&lt;/strong&gt; gets to decide what exactly it is (which you do not know) and where exactly it&amp;rsquo;s placed (which you do).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intimidation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your threats are always treated as credible and requiring &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; checks by anything that can understand them. You could bop a dragon on the shin and say &amp;ldquo;eeeeeehhh nice pile of treasure you got here, be a shame if something happened to it&amp;rdquo; and they would have to make a &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; check. Dragons have very, very high &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; scores, but they still have to make the check.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fencing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of finding a buyer for stolen goods in any settlement, a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of knowing if any given buyer is going to rat you out, and a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of disarming your opponent in a flashy &lt;em&gt;prise de fer&lt;/em&gt; with the first attack you make in each combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pickpocketing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When someone tries to wield an item you have a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of having already stolen it, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach of them within the last hour and should so desire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drinking&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can identify special properties of beverages accurately by taste. When blackout drunk, you only do &lt;strong&gt;cool&lt;/strong&gt; shit, no embarrassing shit, unless it&amp;rsquo;s also super &lt;strong&gt;cool&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eavesdropping&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you listen in on a conversation, the participants are &lt;strong&gt;guaranteed&lt;/strong&gt; to speak about something of interest to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q33dI9uuXXM/YMVik9MC-RI/AAAAAAAAtzs/sAgk5BMcD64nd28szqMfbdkbu1dFqYKSwCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-q33dI9uuXXM/YMVik9MC-RI/AAAAAAAAtzs/sAgk5BMcD64nd28szqMfbdkbu1dFqYKSwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h420/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This guy is a thief, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-vayra-you-hate-generic-classes&#34;&gt;But Vayra, You Hate Generic Classes &lt;a href=&#34;#but-vayra-you-hate-generic-classes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;haha you know what it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://falseidolstla.blogspot.com/2021/06/vain-sword-salt-and-stars-edition.html&#34;&gt;Pirate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;cutlass&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;pistol&lt;/strong&gt; and powder and &lt;strong&gt;10&lt;/strong&gt; balls, a jug of &lt;strong&gt;rum&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; greatcoat, and all the rest but no dark clothing.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can climb and swing on rigging, ropes, and chandeliers like a &lt;strong&gt;monkey&lt;/strong&gt;, and foes in battle must check &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; when you swash your buckle.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: &lt;strong&gt;Wanted&lt;/strong&gt; by all courts of the sea and a few of the land. If caught, you will be hung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**&lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2020/02/thieves-guilds.html&#34;&gt;Courtesan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**Starting Equipment:Three sets of &lt;strong&gt;fine clothing&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), three &lt;strong&gt;fine&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;stilettos&lt;/strong&gt;, three grams of &lt;strong&gt;fine cocaine&lt;/strong&gt;, three palettes of &lt;strong&gt;fine makeup&lt;/strong&gt;, three pieces of &lt;strong&gt;fine jewelry&lt;/strong&gt; (worth &lt;strong&gt;100sp&lt;/strong&gt; each), none of the rest of that nonsense.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:When you speak to someone who isn&amp;rsquo;t hostile to you and could conceivably be romantically interested, you can keep them engaged for &lt;strong&gt;1d6 hours&lt;/strong&gt; to the exclusion of all else.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:You have the romantic interest of &lt;strong&gt;1d3&lt;/strong&gt; powerful, distasteful, and inconvenient suitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-modern-fiddly-firearms.html&#34;&gt;Gunshow Detective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;modern semi-automatic rifle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;one full magazine&lt;/strong&gt;, both of which have definitely been used in at least one murder. A &lt;strong&gt;police&lt;/strong&gt; badge. Some uninteresting clothes. Nothing else.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You have &lt;strong&gt;to-hit&lt;/strong&gt; with firearms as if you were a &lt;strong&gt;fighter&lt;/strong&gt;. You can infer weapon name and stats from spent bullets and/or brass.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: The sound of gunfire that isn&amp;rsquo;t yours causes you to &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; vs. &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/11/a-hired-dick-glog-class-thief-guild.html&#34;&gt;Gumshoe Detective&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; trench coat,a battered &lt;strong&gt;fedora&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;trilby&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;hip flask&lt;/strong&gt; full of good, cheap whiskey, an equally battered, good, and cheap &lt;strong&gt;revolver&lt;/strong&gt;, one &lt;strong&gt;cartridge&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt; slightly squashed &lt;strong&gt;cigarettes&lt;/strong&gt;, alcohol dependency, debt.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can consider any number of &lt;strong&gt;clues&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;personal possessions&lt;/strong&gt;, and/or &lt;strong&gt;the city&lt;/strong&gt; for one full minute to determine how they are connected.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:Each time you do the above you have a &lt;strong&gt;[things]-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of coming down with a splitting migraine that prevents you from doing anything useful until you get a good rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html&#34;&gt;Thug&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;blunt object&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;white undershirt&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;black pants&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;four-pack of tallboys&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;20-pack of 100&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ominous tattoos&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;burner cellphone&lt;/strong&gt;, absolutely nothing else.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:When you &lt;strong&gt;intimidate&lt;/strong&gt; an NPC, they get a penalty to their &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; check equal to the number of the following things that are true: You broke something of their in front of them; you mentioned a specific, non-obvious fact about them; you came up with a good in-character threat; you confronted them somewhere they thought was safe.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You are always assumed to be the person of least importance, unless an action hero is fighting you, in which case they&amp;rsquo;ll take you out first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html&#34;&gt;Gentleman Thief&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;domino mask&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), twenty &lt;strong&gt;calling cards&lt;/strong&gt; (design them in &lt;strong&gt;photoshop&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;ms paint&lt;/strong&gt;, or another &lt;strong&gt;image manipulation program&lt;/strong&gt;), none of that other garbage.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:Your &lt;strong&gt;calling cards&lt;/strong&gt; count as invitations to the most exclusive clubs and parties, can automatically get you out of minor punishments with a minimum of embarrassment, and - once per settlement - excuse you from a death penalty in favor of permanent exile.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:At some point or when you reach template &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; (whichever happens first) the rest of your line will perish, leaving you with an &lt;strong&gt;estate&lt;/strong&gt; in the city, an &lt;strong&gt;estate&lt;/strong&gt; in the country, a &lt;strong&gt;yacht&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;ski lodge&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;crypt&lt;/strong&gt;, at least three &lt;strong&gt;dark secrets&lt;/strong&gt;, 15,000 gp in &lt;strong&gt;gambling arrears&lt;/strong&gt;, and any other grudges your family is owed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html&#34;&gt;Dagger Cultist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:Six &lt;strong&gt;daggers&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;sash&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sheath&lt;/strong&gt; for each dagger, light and loose &lt;strong&gt;ramie&lt;/strong&gt; clothing, the lantern, boots, and cloak you are owed.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:When you whisper the &lt;strong&gt;true name&lt;/strong&gt; of a target to your knives, they automatically hit it when thrown. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t already speak &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;swordsong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; you do now, and short blades speak more intelligently to you than they do to others.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:You sprout visible horns and/or antennae according to your power. If you do, you may be &lt;strong&gt;executed&lt;/strong&gt; as a witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2020/02/thieves-guilds.html&#34;&gt;Archaeologist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:Your &lt;strong&gt;knife&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;S&amp;amp;W M1917 .45 ACP revolver&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;6 cartridges&lt;/strong&gt; in a moon clip, a &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; bullwhip, &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; vest, and &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; hat, the lantern and boots you demand, and no cloak.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can tell when things belong in a museum (exceptionally ancient, powerful, or valuable) at a glance. If someone could know a historically relevant fact, you&amp;rsquo;re that someone.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:When it would be least convenient (to you) and most funny (to the DM), you have a &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; (exploding) chance of discovering snakes, which terrify and upset you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Assassin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;cool spring-loaded wrist blade&lt;/strong&gt; or an &lt;strong&gt;elegantly curved dagger&lt;/strong&gt; (your choice), a loaded &lt;strong&gt;two-shot derringer&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;smoke bomb&lt;/strong&gt;, and your clothing, lantern, et cetera.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can line up lethal shots against distant unaware targets without a roll, as if you were right next to them. If you want it, there&amp;rsquo;s always &lt;strong&gt;work&lt;/strong&gt; available.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Your order will &lt;strong&gt;require&lt;/strong&gt; you to take on certain jobs. Failure would be&amp;hellip; unwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Revolutionary&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;monkey wrench&lt;/strong&gt;, an &lt;strong&gt;iron bomb&lt;/strong&gt;, three &lt;strong&gt;molotov cocktails&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;red bandana&lt;/strong&gt;, your clothes and lantern and such.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:Given an economy with significant wealth inequality, one hour, and a soapbox to speak from, you can cause significant unrest among the lower classes. Make a &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt; roll to determine how well you are able to direct their ire.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:&lt;strong&gt;-2 reaction&lt;/strong&gt; with other &lt;strong&gt;revolutionaries&lt;/strong&gt; (due to leftist infighting) and &lt;strong&gt;agents of authority&lt;/strong&gt; (for obvious reasons) as long as your identity is known. Both of the above will pen screeds and tirades against you and have them delivered to you by messenger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cat Burglar&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_paw_(nail_puller)&#34;&gt;cat&amp;rsquo;s paw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, a pair of &lt;strong&gt;razor-clawed gloves&lt;/strong&gt;, a small (cat-sized) &lt;strong&gt;burlap sack&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;cat&lt;/strong&gt;, dark clothing, soft boots, no lantern.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can see by starlight as if it were daylight, climb and balance like a &lt;strong&gt;cat&lt;/strong&gt;, and pounce about fifteen feet when making an attack.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:Slit pupils and twitchy, furred ears and tail mark you as some sort of horrible mutant. You have a &lt;strong&gt;prey scent&lt;/strong&gt; and will be attacked immediately by large predators and prioritized as a target by foes with strong aesthetic sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kingnapper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A crudely forged &lt;strong&gt;iron dagger&lt;/strong&gt;, enough &lt;strong&gt;stout hemp rope&lt;/strong&gt; to bind a king, a large (king-sized) &lt;strong&gt;burlap sack&lt;/strong&gt;, clothes and lantern and such.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can carry &lt;strong&gt;one&lt;/strong&gt;securely bound person in a sack as easily as if they were, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, a &lt;strong&gt;3 slot&lt;/strong&gt; sack of potatoes.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You&amp;rsquo;re responsible for the care and feeding of any king you kingnap. Allowing one to die in your care will see you hunted to the ends of the earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Skaven&#34;&gt;Sewer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Twitch&#34;&gt;Rat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;viciously hooked cutlass&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;repeating crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;20 bolts&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;gas mask&lt;/strong&gt;, clothes and cloak and lamp and whatnot.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can speak &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;chew&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; if you couldn&amp;rsquo;t already, and summon &lt;strong&gt;[minutes spent chanting]^2&lt;/strong&gt; rats with a secret incantation, up to the number of rats reasonably present wherever you are. They aren&amp;rsquo;t automatically obedient, roll &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt; as normal.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:The stench of the sewers is permanently upon you, and it is &lt;strong&gt;gross&lt;/strong&gt;. If you ever manage to scrub it off, you lose your rat-summoning powers and rats won&amp;rsquo;t talk to you until you get good and grimy again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aerialist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:** 100&amp;rsquo;** of high-quality silk, assorted &lt;strong&gt;swivels&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;carabiners&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;clips&lt;/strong&gt;, an elaborately tasseled &lt;strong&gt;jian&lt;/strong&gt;, none of that other trash.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You weigh about a third as much as you would if you weren&amp;rsquo;t an &lt;strong&gt;aerialist&lt;/strong&gt;, and can swing from silks, vines, rigging, kites, and chandeliers like a &lt;strong&gt;monkey&lt;/strong&gt;. Treat falls as though they were &lt;strong&gt;20&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; shorter than they actually are.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:Hollow bird bones break easily, giving you &lt;strong&gt;-2 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;Secret&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-8th-mysteries-and-baited-hooks.html&#34;&gt;Agent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;silenced small-caliber pistol&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;one magazine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;7 cartridges&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), a &lt;strong&gt;nice watch&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;secret communication device&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can &lt;strong&gt;call for backup&lt;/strong&gt; to have a &lt;strong&gt;level&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; member of your organization with an appropriate class appear from an unlikely hiding spot to assist you with a single task. If you get them killed, Headquarters won&amp;rsquo;t send you another one for &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; weeks.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:Your organization will, naturally, give you &lt;strong&gt;tasks&lt;/strong&gt; to accomplish in order to further their &lt;strong&gt;interests&lt;/strong&gt; in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html&#34;&gt;Gambler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;loaded two-shot derringer&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;straw boater&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), a cloak and a lamp and a whatnot.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit but also Drawback:When you succeed at a &lt;strong&gt;d20&lt;/strong&gt; roll, you can choose to roll it again for &lt;strong&gt;double or nothing&lt;/strong&gt;. A success on the second roll upgrades your result to that of a &lt;strong&gt;critical success&lt;/strong&gt;, while a failure downgrades it to a &lt;strong&gt;fumble&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escape Artist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_The Escape Artist has vanished from the confines of this blogpost. If any of you see it, please let me know.&lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Lexi&lt;/a&gt; has found the Escape Artist. Here she is:&lt;br&gt;
_Starting Equipment:A set of &lt;strong&gt;lockpicks&lt;/strong&gt;, a pot of &lt;strong&gt;grease&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;catsuit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt;, your choice), an incredibly valuable and even more &lt;strong&gt;incredibly stolen gemstone&lt;/strong&gt;, twenty small and worthless &lt;strong&gt;signature trinkets&lt;/strong&gt;, none of that other garbage.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can squeeze through spaces slightly smaller than your head, and wriggle effortlessly free from &lt;strong&gt;mundane&lt;/strong&gt; bonds.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You are compelled to leave your &lt;strong&gt;signature trinkets&lt;/strong&gt; at the scene of every crime or other significant happening, to prove how much better you are than the authorities. You are pursued by a bumbling but persistent &lt;strong&gt;investigator&lt;/strong&gt; (perhaps a &lt;strong&gt;gumshoe detective&lt;/strong&gt;) who has staked their career and reputation on catching you; should they perish or be fired for their incompetence, you will receive a new one following the next time you leave a &lt;strong&gt;signature trinket&lt;/strong&gt; somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Disgraced Former) Stage Magician&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:A &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), a &lt;strong&gt;very sharp hand-saw&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;deck of trick playing cards&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;deck of non-trick playing cards&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;very tall hat&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;false bottom&lt;/strong&gt;, the &lt;strong&gt;top half of a rabbit&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can cut willing (or unaware) people in half without killing them, which is very impressive.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance you can&amp;rsquo;t put them back together 😳&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mafioso&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:An &lt;strong&gt;M1921 Thompson Submachine Gun, Caliber .45&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;drum magazine&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;100 cartridges&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;violin case&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), a &lt;strong&gt;nice cigar&lt;/strong&gt;, none of that other stuff.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You&amp;rsquo;re part of a &lt;em&gt;famiglia&lt;/em&gt;, and can scare up &lt;strong&gt;1d6 Little Italian Boys&lt;/strong&gt; at a moment&amp;rsquo;s notice plus travel time to and from &lt;strong&gt;Little Italy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:&lt;strong&gt;Little Italian Boys&lt;/strong&gt; are a rowdy bunch, difficult to direct effectively. Until you&amp;rsquo;ve reached template &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; (and become a &lt;em&gt;capo&lt;/em&gt;), you must answer the call when &lt;strong&gt;1d6 Little Italian Boys&lt;/strong&gt; are needed by another &lt;strong&gt;mafioso&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shadowdancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:You just get the normal stuff, honestly.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:You can step into any &lt;strong&gt;shadow&lt;/strong&gt; and out of any other within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw (that you can see).&lt;br&gt;
Drawback:When you step through a &lt;strong&gt;shadow&lt;/strong&gt; you have an &lt;strong&gt;X-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of losing a random item, where &lt;strong&gt;X&lt;/strong&gt; is the number of times you&amp;rsquo;ve stepped through &lt;strong&gt;shadows&lt;/strong&gt; that day. You don&amp;rsquo;t cast a **shadow **of your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Very Leetle Mountain Classes</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/05/very-leetle-mountain-classes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 03 May 2021 20:26:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/05/very-leetle-mountain-classes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Mountain classes are &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;too big.&lt;/a&gt; To correct for that, here&amp;rsquo;re some &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; leetle versions of the same classes. They &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be MOSAIC STRICT, whatever that is. They also might not be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think they&amp;rsquo;re pretty good examples of &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2021/05/simplified-classes.html&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;problem&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2021/05/problem-children-anthology-of-new.html&#34;&gt;children&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; class design and I&amp;rsquo;m proud of them for what they are. They&amp;rsquo;re a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; minimalist for my taste, honestly. I shall continue the Work of finding a middle ground for games I actually intend to run, hah, heh, hoo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u-E8oYY0MFo/YJCuJbQ_KxI/AAAAAAAAsVg/md1ZYVWm41E9-3FpGzJtobjqi9TH7pT8wCLcBGAsYHQ/3fa3f73d6bcbccd9105a1ea2023b4a64.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-u-E8oYY0MFo/YJCuJbQ_KxI/AAAAAAAAsVg/md1ZYVWm41E9-3FpGzJtobjqi9TH7pT8wCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h448/3fa3f73d6bcbccd9105a1ea2023b4a64.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-paladin&#34;&gt;Class: Paladin &lt;a href=&#34;#class-paladin&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every paladin has a Revelation; a vision which causes them to break with the dogma of the Church and leads them on a divine mission. Every paladin is a prophet, an apostate, and a heretic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Given three seconds, oxygen, a functioning breath cycle, and at least one hand capable of being cupped, &lt;strong&gt;start a very small fire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refuse to be &lt;strong&gt;burned&lt;/strong&gt; by any fire of not-specifically-malicious intent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eventually, receive a &lt;strong&gt;shimmering halo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create your character, choose one &lt;strong&gt;holy order&lt;/strong&gt; to have learned the traditions of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Choirs Invocant orate and castigate with thundering voices that &lt;strong&gt;cannot be ignored&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inquisitors Avengeant suffer physical harm from speaking untruths, and can &lt;strong&gt;see lies&lt;/strong&gt; spoken by others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Templars Contemplative always connect meaningfully with &lt;strong&gt;special moves&lt;/strong&gt; that they name and describe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Warminds Scrivener command &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; with names like &lt;strong&gt;Fireball&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Lightning&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Missile&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; and detail the &lt;strong&gt;portfolio&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;deeds&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;method of martyrdom&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;ritual observances&lt;/strong&gt; of a saint. For each of these you write down, one of the following &lt;strong&gt;prayers&lt;/strong&gt; will be answered once that day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O Holy Illuminator, bathe this place in the glory of your Light and make all things visible within it—&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O Cleansing Warmth, grant this servant the touch that burns away wounds and illness, and makes all things hale and pure—&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O Blinding Radiance, drive my foes before me like shadows before your Light, and undo any Sorceries which they have wrought—&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Qh43bLXT9PQ/YJCulOX9wMI/AAAAAAAAsVw/3s63wNjw70QcKwKBmQYaVk460r2LSYFGACLcBGAsYHQ/16-clarke-faust_900.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Qh43bLXT9PQ/YJCulOX9wMI/AAAAAAAAsVw/3s63wNjw70QcKwKBmQYaVk460r2LSYFGACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h549/16-clarke-faust_900.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-witch-true&#34;&gt;Class: Witch (True) &lt;a href=&#34;#class-witch-true&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Witches are dark creatures born to followers of the Old Ways who have consorted with spirits, monsters, or beasts. More monster than man, they are an object of both fear and awe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you can do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Melt, burn, or wither away when faced with the object of your &lt;strong&gt;supernatural weakness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inflict nonspecific bad luck with the &lt;strong&gt;evil eye&lt;/strong&gt;, or very specific bad luck with a &lt;strong&gt;curse&lt;/strong&gt; if the target has personally wronged you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes receive actual information from the &lt;strong&gt;GM&lt;/strong&gt; when you &lt;strong&gt;cast the bones&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create your character, choose one &lt;strong&gt;familiar&lt;/strong&gt; you are able to create from your flesh:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As many &lt;strong&gt;guns&lt;/strong&gt; as you can carry, which emerge fully loaded&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A swarm of your favorite &lt;strong&gt;bugs&lt;/strong&gt;, which share your mind&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A magical &lt;strong&gt;friend&lt;/strong&gt;, who imposes restrictions and warps your body, but grants you boons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A big &lt;strong&gt;tumor&lt;/strong&gt;, which renders diseases harmless to you and easily transmissible to others&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each day, choose one &lt;strong&gt;rhyme&lt;/strong&gt; you are able to make true by **chanting **it ominously, &lt;strong&gt;cackling&lt;/strong&gt;, and offering a small &lt;strong&gt;sacrifice:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bigger, smaller, I&amp;rsquo;ll decide—your current size I won&amp;rsquo;t abide!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red and yellow, blue and green—your true form shall not be seen!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Look at you, hale or sick—your present health, it shall not stick!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All your secrets I shall spy—with my creeping, crawling eye!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;With ragged flesh and loyal bone—this corpse shall serve, its will my own!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lung of toad, essence of bog—I will exhale poison fog!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ymf8s7Tn_KM/YJCu3RlcN4I/AAAAAAAAsWI/WKZuXkA6kRsDgMIRCNgO4mulaniEaddlACLcBGAsYHQ/storyofkingrober00mack_0101.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ymf8s7Tn_KM/YJCu3RlcN4I/AAAAAAAAsWI/WKZuXkA6kRsDgMIRCNgO4mulaniEaddlACLcBGAsYHQ/w437-h640/storyofkingrober00mack_0101.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-witch-false&#34;&gt;Class: Witch (False) &lt;a href=&#34;#class-witch-false&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False witches are scholars, adventurers, thieves, tricksters, explorers, well versed in the magic present in the world and experts in bending it to their use. They steal, find, buy, or create magic through ritual, rather than any power held within themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you can do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sustain yourself **indefinitely **through a combination of begging, scavenging, foraging, and stealing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pick shoddy locks in an **instant **and any other type in a &lt;strong&gt;minute or two&lt;/strong&gt;, even with makeshift tools&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Climb&lt;/strong&gt;, without equipment, anything that a properly-equipped person could&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forge &lt;strong&gt;documents&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;seals&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;signatures&lt;/strong&gt; given even a passing description of the original&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always have a &lt;strong&gt;small knife&lt;/strong&gt;, a **coin **of negligible value, precisely thirteen feet of strong &lt;strong&gt;twine&lt;/strong&gt;, a stub of &lt;strong&gt;chalk&lt;/strong&gt;, and a piece of &lt;strong&gt;charcoal&lt;/strong&gt; on your person&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create your character, choose one &lt;strong&gt;physical magic&lt;/strong&gt; that you have learned the secrets of and acquired one example of already:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic swords, which you can **communicate with **at your leisure and &lt;strong&gt;carry any number&lt;/strong&gt; of without issue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic bottles, into which you can **coax **spirits or **capture **souls for later release to do your bidding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Magic masks, which grant you the &lt;strong&gt;appearance&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;abilities&lt;/strong&gt; of the person or beast you made them from&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RdL_nZURumM/YJCupJmCx5I/AAAAAAAAsV4/6hYMSlksNislFFCg6PuPb7fbQSLx0RBjACLcBGAsYHQ/fatal-blow-1600.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-RdL_nZURumM/YJCupJmCx5I/AAAAAAAAsV4/6hYMSlksNislFFCg6PuPb7fbQSLx0RBjACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h537/fatal-blow-1600.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;class-gutter-knight&#34;&gt;Class: Gutter Knight &lt;a href=&#34;#class-gutter-knight&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gutter knights are noble scions, who journey and commit acts of conspicuous heroism as a coming-of-age ritual before eventually hanging up their cloak and returning to take their place in the gentry; theoretically humbled and made wiser by their experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things you can do: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not possess any amount of &lt;strong&gt;currency&lt;/strong&gt;, nor anything else beyond a &lt;strong&gt;mount&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;saddle&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;riding tack&lt;/strong&gt;, and whatever you can &lt;strong&gt;carry on your person&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rely on your &lt;strong&gt;family name&lt;/strong&gt; to secure respect, food, lodging, and &lt;strong&gt;knightly quests&lt;/strong&gt; in any settlement large enough to have a mayor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Defeat any single person, most duos of people, and especially pusillanimous trios and quartets in a fair &lt;strong&gt;contest of strength or arms&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take a blow that was meant for one of your &lt;strong&gt;allies within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you create your character or complete a &lt;strong&gt;knightly quest&lt;/strong&gt;, sew a new &lt;strong&gt;patch-favor&lt;/strong&gt; to your cloak with a thematic ability which can be used &lt;strong&gt;once&lt;/strong&gt; per day:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Torch&lt;/strong&gt;, for rescuing a peasant boy from a cave. Sets something on fire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Paper soldier&lt;/strong&gt;, for defending a library from book-burners. Grapples with the strength of five strong men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mighty oak&lt;/strong&gt;, for saving a dryad&amp;rsquo;s grove from loggers. Makes a big tree, very fast.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trick rope&lt;/strong&gt;, for rescuing a street performer from the gallows. Creates 50&amp;rsquo; of animate rope that obeys your commands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Windmill&lt;/strong&gt;, for putting out a village fire. Blows anything not securely anchored to the ground away with a gust of wind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conch&lt;/strong&gt;, for extricating a nymph from a fishing net. Summons a pack of friendly sea lions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;amp;c, &amp;amp;c. This is just a starting list, not exhaustive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Did I need another Fighter? Probably not. Did I write one anyway? Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a trend, I think, of minimal classes. Minimal wizards, even. Or maybe there isn&amp;rsquo;t, I don&amp;rsquo;t know, I can&amp;rsquo;t find the blogpost if there is one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is only tangentially related to that, at best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s more closely related to &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2021/03/how-could-i-of-all-people-fall-silent.html&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;, perhaps. An attempt to distill down the essence of &amp;lsquo;Fighter&amp;rsquo;. Less fiddly than a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html&#34;&gt;FIGHTMASTER&lt;/a&gt;, less flashy than a wave-dancing samurai duelist, less setting-bound than a Gutter Knight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oh, I guess it&amp;rsquo;s also related to &lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/01/osr-how-to-design-glog-fighters.html&#34;&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&#34;https://dungeonantology.com/2020/08/09/glog-class-design/&#34;&gt;these&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K0F7EpHhbJE/YFFMVbOuVPI/AAAAAAAArio/_WYhIpWAU6I4ntHgRtExqa2xubAXMI4xgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1554/Minors%252BSwords%252BKing.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-K0F7EpHhbJE/YFFMVbOuVPI/AAAAAAAArio/_WYhIpWAU6I4ntHgRtExqa2xubAXMI4xgCLcBGAsYHQ/w370-h640/Minors%252BSwords%252BKing.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;King of Swords.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Class: Ultimate Fighter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every template of Fighter you have gives you &lt;strong&gt;+1 to-hit&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;+1 HP&lt;/strong&gt;. If you&amp;rsquo;re playing in a system with &lt;strong&gt;proficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, you have it in all forms of weapon, armor, and shield that your character could theoretically have seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Wrestling, Small-Unit Tactics, and one of &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Warfare &lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; Crime &lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; Wilderness &lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; Oceangoing&lt;br&gt;
Your skills are intentionally fairly broad. Fighters are skilled folk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A &lt;strong&gt;melee weapon&lt;/strong&gt; of your choice, a &lt;strong&gt;ranged weapon&lt;/strong&gt; of your choice and &lt;strong&gt;ammunition&lt;/strong&gt; for it if applicable, good &lt;strong&gt;travelling clothes&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;big backpack&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;two-man tent&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;lantern&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;oil&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;armor&lt;/strong&gt; of some sort, and a &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt; if you want one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A **Parry, Expertise, Versatility&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Steel Gaze&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Whirlwind&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Death-Dealer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Parry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each round, you can negate up to &lt;strong&gt;[templates]&lt;/strong&gt; points of damage in total that would be dealt to you or adjacent allies by melee attacks that you are aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Expertise&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whenever you hit someone with an attack, you can attempt a &lt;strong&gt;combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; against them for free as long as you can narrate how that&amp;rsquo;d work. Perhaps pinning their arm to a door with your crossbow bolt allows you to &lt;strong&gt;grapple&lt;/strong&gt; or **disarm **them from a distance, or your sword blow combines with a quick stomp on their instep to &lt;strong&gt;trip&lt;/strong&gt; them up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: &lt;a href=&#34;https://xenophonsramblings.blogspot.com/2020/06/glog-weapons-armor-and-combat.html&#34;&gt;Versatility&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Weapons you wield, even improvised ones, deal &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; base damage if they would normally deal less. If you have a &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; penalty, it no longer applies to your attack, damage, or &lt;strong&gt;grappling&lt;/strong&gt; rolls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Steel Gaze&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can project an aura of intimidating calm at will. While active, &lt;strong&gt;nameless mooks&lt;/strong&gt; and **dumb animals **will avoid fucking with you if at all possible, and anyone who cares to look will become instantly convinced of your ability as a warrior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;nameless mook&lt;/strong&gt; is anyone of about &lt;strong&gt;2 HD&lt;/strong&gt; or less that the DM hasn&amp;rsquo;t bothered to give a name to yet. A &lt;strong&gt;dumb animal&lt;/strong&gt; is any living, non-supernatural thing that can&amp;rsquo;t talk or eat you whole and isn&amp;rsquo;t under immediate supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Whirlwind&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can make one extra attack each round for free. Alternately, in place of &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; of your normal attacks for a round you can make one attack against &lt;strong&gt;each&lt;/strong&gt; opponent that you could reasonably target with one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Death-Dealer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your attacks that hit &lt;strong&gt;nameless mooks&lt;/strong&gt; automatically incapacitate or kill them (your choice), with no need to roll damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;but-vayra-you-hate-generic-classes&#34;&gt;But Vayra, You Hate Generic Classes &lt;a href=&#34;#but-vayra-you-hate-generic-classes&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I do, I do. But this isn&amp;rsquo;t just a generic class, it&amp;rsquo;s a class &lt;em&gt;chassis&lt;/em&gt;. A classis, you could call it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some archetypes you could glue on top if it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.starjammersrd.com/classes/solarian/&#34;&gt;Magical Girl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment and also Benefit:  Your starting weapons and armor are made of light, magic, love, or hope, do not require ammunition, disappear if removed from your person, and can be summoned back into existence by undergoing a &lt;strong&gt;magical girl transformation sequence&lt;/strong&gt; which takes about one full round.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with weapons or armor aside from your magical girl equipment. In order to use your &lt;strong&gt;expertise&lt;/strong&gt;, you have to shout the name of whatever &lt;strong&gt;special move&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Your &lt;strong&gt;magical girl transformation sequence&lt;/strong&gt; can&amp;rsquo;t be performed while intoxicated, scared, depressed, or otherwise suffering an emotional crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. &lt;a href=&#34;https://occultronics.blogspot.com/2020/05/good-elves.html&#34;&gt;Elf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:  Your &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt; armor, &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt;, elaborately filigreed &lt;strong&gt;rapier&lt;/strong&gt;, and the heads of the &lt;strong&gt;20 arrows&lt;/strong&gt; for your &lt;strong&gt;longbow&lt;/strong&gt; are made of mithril, weigh nothing, and can wound ghosts and angels.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:  You can see as well in starlight, torchlight, or twilight as a normal man can see on a sunny day, and will effectively never age. Those affected by your &lt;strong&gt;steel gaze&lt;/strong&gt; know you as not only a warrior, but a noble one.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Dirt and grime deal actual, physical damage to you. When wronged, you must roll a &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; or swear an oath of vengeance. You cannot break such oaths if you have the opportunity to make good on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/wave-dancing-samurai-katana-duelists.html&#34;&gt;Wave-Dancing Samurai Katana Duelist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment:  Your &lt;strong&gt;katana&lt;/strong&gt; has been folded over 1,000 times and can cut through lesser blades. You also have a &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt; gusoku, a &lt;strong&gt;longbow&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;20 arrows&lt;/strong&gt;. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a shield, and aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with them.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit:  You can walk on water. This is exactly as badass as it sounds and NPCs will react appropriately.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Wave-Dancing Samurai Katana Dueling is a dying art. You&amp;rsquo;ll never meet another of your kind, and nobody else can ever play another one in the same setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Knight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: Your &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt; carries the crest of your noble house, which was once esteemed but has declined in standing due to the mistakes of your father. You also have a &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;lance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;plate&lt;/strong&gt; armor, and a well-trained &lt;strong&gt;warhorse&lt;/strong&gt;. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a ranged weapon, and aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with any.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Your name carries respect, and you have a &lt;strong&gt;squire&lt;/strong&gt;, who is useless in combat but generally adept at handling non-Knightly business in your stead. When you issue a &lt;strong&gt;challenge&lt;/strong&gt;, anyone with honor is compelled to accept it or lose standing in the eyes of the gods, the nobility, and upright citizens.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You straight up cannot bring yourself to do un-Knightly things. Your squire has to do them for you. If a pretty lady asks you to do something, you have to do it unless you can explain why a &lt;em&gt;different&lt;/em&gt; pretty lady is preventing you from doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/10/osr-class-sword-exorcist.html&#34;&gt;Ghost Inquisitor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt; in a jeweled scabbard. A bunch of &lt;strong&gt;medicine&lt;/strong&gt; in your big backpack. A bunch of paper covered in &lt;strong&gt;warding sigils&lt;/strong&gt;. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a ranged weapon, armor, or a shield, but you&amp;rsquo;re still &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; in them if you find some.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can identify undead at a glance, and see lies. Your &lt;strong&gt;warding sigils&lt;/strong&gt; prevent undead from passing them until destroyed.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You aren&amp;rsquo;t allowed to harm undead unless you see them initiate conflict. Breaking this rule makes your &lt;strong&gt;warding sigils&lt;/strong&gt; and **ability to see lies **stop working and may see you hunted by other &lt;strong&gt;ghost inquisitors&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Dungeons_&amp;amp;_Dragons_4th_edition&#34;&gt;Lance Rogue&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;lance&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; armor, a &lt;strong&gt;ludicrously ineffective hand crossbow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;20 tiny bolts&lt;/strong&gt;. You don&amp;rsquo;t get a shield or &lt;strong&gt;proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; with one.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: When you hit a &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt; foe with your lance, your damage is multiplied by &lt;strong&gt;2 + (3.5 - (3.4 / (1 + (([templates] + 1)/3.5)^1.1)))&lt;/strong&gt;. Do not round.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Excess lance damage is dealt to everyone surrounding your target, including you. Also, you have to track fractional hit points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Warrior Baron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;bow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;20 arrows&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt; armor.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can hire &lt;strong&gt;fighters&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;archers&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;barbarians&lt;/strong&gt;, and other **martial types **for a regular wage rather than a share of treasure. If you ever come into the possession (not necessarily the ownership) of a significant quantity of land, peasants and artisans will start to show up to work it for you under the assumption that you&amp;rsquo;ll protect them.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Softer (read: more successful and powerful) nobles will never recognize your claims. Your successes will be met with increasing unease on their behalf, and eventually they will raise armies to put yours down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. Tunnel Fighter, also known as Dwarf&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;shortspear&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;6&lt;/strong&gt; more &lt;strong&gt;lanterns&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;plate&lt;/strong&gt; that only covers your head, arms, and shoulders(as &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; unless you&amp;rsquo;re in a tunnel or significantly shorter than your opponent, then as &lt;strong&gt;plate&lt;/strong&gt;). No shield, no ranged weapon, no &lt;strong&gt;proficiency&lt;/strong&gt; with either.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: When &lt;strong&gt;you&amp;rsquo;re&lt;/strong&gt; in a tunnel, you&amp;rsquo;re no easier to hit than you would be on an infinite featureless plain and you never get &lt;strong&gt;stuck&lt;/strong&gt;. When your &lt;strong&gt;opponent&lt;/strong&gt; is in a tunnel, you have &lt;strong&gt;advantage&lt;/strong&gt; on attacks against them.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Agoraphobia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/10/eyes-and-nostrils-hotter-than-hell.html&#34;&gt;Horizon Walker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;sabre&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;revolver&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;12 cartridges&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;big hat&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; armor, &lt;strong&gt;magic manacles&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;badge&lt;/strong&gt;, and a book of &lt;strong&gt;court summonses&lt;/strong&gt;. No shield, but you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; if you find one.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You are empowered to make &lt;strong&gt;arrests&lt;/strong&gt; of demons, devils, genies, angels, modrons, and other planar entities. Arrestees are legally forbidden (but not physically prevented) from taking direct action against you and must show up for their planar court dates. If you call for &lt;strong&gt;backup&lt;/strong&gt;, two junior &lt;strong&gt;horizon walkers&lt;/strong&gt; will show up nearby to assist you within &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; minutes and remain at your side until you are reasonably safe.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Spurious arrests will get you in trouble with &lt;strong&gt;interdimensional affairs&lt;/strong&gt;, headquarters will refuse to send you backup for &lt;strong&gt;1d6 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; per junior agent that dies helping you, and nobody likes cops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-barbarian.html&#34;&gt;Foreigner&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: Two &lt;strong&gt;unique and impractical&lt;/strong&gt; (for anyone else)weapons. Armor &lt;strong&gt;made from something weird&lt;/strong&gt; (as &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt;). You can have a &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt; of the same material, if you desire. Two &lt;strong&gt;drinks nobody here has heard of&lt;/strong&gt;, one delicious to any taste and one intoxicating to any constitution.&lt;br&gt;
Benefits and also Drawbacks: Click the link up there. Roll five advantages and five drawbacks, and choose four of each from the ones rolled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11. Jedi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: An &lt;strong&gt;elegant weapon, for a more civilized age&lt;/strong&gt;. No armor, no ranged weapon, no shield. You retain your &lt;strong&gt;proficiency&lt;/strong&gt;, but disdain their use.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can exert non-impacting force on things within a stone&amp;rsquo;s throw (push, lift, pull, throw, etc) as if you were standing next to them, can &lt;strong&gt;parry&lt;/strong&gt; ranged attacks and spells, and can jump about thirty feet.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Whenever you do something completely immoral (harm an &lt;strong&gt;innocent&lt;/strong&gt;, attempt to reverse death, demand payment for services rendered) you gain a &lt;strong&gt;dark side point&lt;/strong&gt; and look a little bit more like a corpse. If your &lt;strong&gt;dark side points&lt;/strong&gt; ever exceed your &lt;strong&gt;templates&lt;/strong&gt;, you gain the ability to shoot lightning out of your hands and become a recurring NPC villain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-sword-swallower.html&#34;&gt;Sword-Swallower&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;shortsword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;mediumsword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;longsword&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;greatsword&lt;/strong&gt;. You can have &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt; armor if you want, but you don&amp;rsquo;t get a ranged weapon or a shield and aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with either.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can swallow anything that&amp;rsquo;s vaguely swordlike, including knives and bladed spears, keep up to &lt;strong&gt;templates times 2&lt;/strong&gt; of them in your gullet at a time, spit them about as far as you could throw a javelin as a ranged attack, and—upon reaching your &lt;strong&gt;fourth&lt;/strong&gt; template—&lt;strong&gt;fuse&lt;/strong&gt; swallowed swords together over the course of a long rest.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You can&amp;rsquo;t eat normal food, you have to eat swords. &lt;strong&gt;1/3 slot&lt;/strong&gt; of sword sustains you for a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;13. Gunslinger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: Two &lt;strong&gt;revolvers&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;36 cartridges&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;big knife&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;big hat&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;big poncho&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;big coat&lt;/strong&gt; (your choice, as &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt;), no shield and you&amp;rsquo;re not &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with them or any kind of actual armor.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can choose to already have your gun drawn, cocked, and aimed pretty much whenever you want. If you enter combat and aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt;, your enemies are.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: When something startles you, you automatically quick-draw on it and must &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; (once per gun, if you have and can wield more than one) in order to not pull the trigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;14. &lt;a href=&#34;https://sameissharkinjapanese.blogspot.com/2020/09/glog-class-sporting-good-chap.html#more&#34;&gt;Gentleman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), a &lt;strong&gt;nice hat&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;nice cane&lt;/strong&gt;. None of that other garbage, but you&amp;rsquo;re still &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; if it matters.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Your &lt;strong&gt;versatility&lt;/strong&gt; applies to your unarmed attacks. Those affected by your &lt;strong&gt;steel gaze&lt;/strong&gt; will assume you have powerful and important connections that are personally relevant to them, which will get you into any fancy dinner party or club and might have other uses besides.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You are functionally incapable of disguising your membership in high society, and must &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid responding to perceived insults (real or imagined) with threats or a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;15. &lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/05/full-glog-hack-vain-sword.html&#34;&gt;Ghoul, or Cannibal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;nice suit&lt;/strong&gt; (+1 &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt;, not armor), a &lt;strong&gt;big knife&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sharp teeth&lt;/strong&gt;. None of that other garbage, but you&amp;rsquo;re still **proficient **if it matters.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Whenever you eat something that could talk, you may choose to gain a relevant &lt;strong&gt;special ability&lt;/strong&gt; or **+2 stat bonus **(the DM will tell you which), which replaces any previous benefit from this ability. You can eat carrion safely, no matter how long it&amp;rsquo;s been dead.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You can&amp;rsquo;t eat normal food, you have to eat things that can talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;16. Artist, Martial&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: Bandage-like &lt;strong&gt;wrappings&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;robe&lt;/strong&gt;. None of that other garbage, and you&amp;rsquo;re not &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with armor, shields, or any weapon that isn&amp;rsquo;t suitably exotic. Tying a tassel onto one or chaining two together will usually count, in a pinch.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Your &lt;strong&gt;versatility&lt;/strong&gt; applies to your unarmed attacks, and you can make one even with your hands full or from about as far as you could throw a rock. You enter a state of &lt;strong&gt;suspended animation&lt;/strong&gt; while meditating. You can run on walls or spikes or water as long as you end your turn on solid ground.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: In order to use your &lt;strong&gt;expertise&lt;/strong&gt;, you have to shout the name of whatever &lt;strong&gt;special move&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re doing. Also the &lt;strong&gt;proficiencies&lt;/strong&gt;, I guess.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;17. Berserker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;really big axe&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;really big sword&lt;/strong&gt; (your choice). No armor, but plenty of woad and you&amp;rsquo;re still &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with it if you put some on. No ranged weapon or shield and you&amp;rsquo;re not &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; with either, but you can throw stuff just fine.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You gain bonus hit points equal to &lt;strong&gt;templates&lt;/strong&gt; times the number of categories of armor you aren&amp;rsquo;t wearing, i.e. &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re wearing &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re wearing &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re not wearing any armor at all (clothing is optional). These hit points are lost first and automatically refill whenever you enter combat.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: You must &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; in order to retreat from a fight, once started. You can try again every round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;18. &lt;a href=&#34;https://madcartographer.com/2020/04/26/glog-class-soldier/&#34;&gt;Veteran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: An old &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt;, an old &lt;strong&gt;rifle&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;10 cartridges&lt;/strong&gt;, an old &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt;, an old set of &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt; armor, and an old &lt;strong&gt;banner&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You get &lt;strong&gt;+templates to-hit&lt;/strong&gt; as long as you&amp;rsquo;re at least two of: At full HP, in formation, or following a plan that has not yet gone awry. You get to &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; twice against &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;, and if you pass either of them everyone in your company gets to &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; twice as well.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: For every &lt;strong&gt;template&lt;/strong&gt;, one of your &lt;strong&gt;old wounds&lt;/strong&gt; starts acting up or one of your &lt;strong&gt;old fears&lt;/strong&gt; resurfaces. Figure out what that does with your DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;19. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o0u5oYevFv0J38g-DL6fK3SP7IA0ISyTdVgF_qD064/edit&#34;&gt;Hell Veteran&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A black iron &lt;strong&gt;sword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;carbine&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;10 silver bullets&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt; emblazoned with scripture, and a set of fireproof &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; armor including high rubber-and-iron-soled boots.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: You can taste curses and supernatural evil, judge your approximate distance below ground level, and subsist without water as long as you have food.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: A blackbird follows you everywhere. If you kill one, two more return to replace it at midnight. This stacks infinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;20. &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-o0u5oYevFv0J38g-DL6fK3SP7IA0ISyTdVgF_qD064/edit&#34;&gt;Teuchter, also known as Highlander, which I&amp;rsquo;ve decided is a type of Bard&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Starting Equipment: A &lt;strong&gt;kilt&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;two-handed sword&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;goosed blunderbuss&lt;/strong&gt;, and a &lt;strong&gt;musical instrument&lt;/strong&gt; of your choice. No armor or shield, but you&amp;rsquo;re still &lt;strong&gt;proficient&lt;/strong&gt; in their use.&lt;br&gt;
Benefit: Foes must &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; in order to target anyone but you with their attacks while you roar or sing, and those with equal or fewer &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; than you must check &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt;. The latter effect only works once per opponent.&lt;br&gt;
Drawback: Everyone will assume you&amp;rsquo;re some sort of barbarian, explain things to you condescendingly, and put very little effort into understanding your accent.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Converting GLOG classes to B/X (also, an example)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/02/converting-glog-classes-to-bx-also.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Feb 2021 12:35:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/02/converting-glog-classes-to-bx-also.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--_cBEeMQ2vc/YDadTTiF4ZI/AAAAAAAAq1A/z6s4oMmxzKYdTOCSZpyVFVuYcUdWG1l3QCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/image0.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--_cBEeMQ2vc/YDadTTiF4ZI/AAAAAAAAq1A/z6s4oMmxzKYdTOCSZpyVFVuYcUdWG1l3QCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/image0.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has come to my attention that some people don&amp;rsquo;t understand how to play GLOG classes in B/X (or OSE, as the case may be). They labor under the mistaken assumption that you have to &amp;ldquo;convert&amp;rdquo; them, and need &amp;ldquo;guidance&amp;rdquo; to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is eminently false.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in the service of accessibility and reducing the number of falsehoods that are present on this earth, I will explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;you-dont-have-to-convert-them-at-all&#34;&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to convert them at all. &lt;a href=&#34;#you-dont-have-to-convert-them-at-all&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s pithy, but almost true. More accurately, the conversion is one step in the simplest cases, and like, three in the most complex:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eM27nTEYM0U/YDaehE7duiI/AAAAAAAAq1Q/6riKu8iVzmkOFqlsefdYlQ6jXzzCiZSNwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1131/Screenshot%2B2021-02-24%2B104402.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eM27nTEYM0U/YDaehE7duiI/AAAAAAAAq1Q/6riKu8iVzmkOFqlsefdYlQ6jXzzCiZSNwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h230/Screenshot%2B2021-02-24%2B104402.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://wizzzargh.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Wizzzargh&lt;/a&gt; is talking about BFRPG, not B/X, but the same principles apply. Also I played in their game; it worked just fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-i-will-give-you-some-examples&#34;&gt;Here, I will give you some examples. &lt;a href=&#34;#here-i-will-give-you-some-examples&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DzU0QLWHz-g/YDaif6PUGQI/AAAAAAAAq1s/3IuQWRfLh00s_fm5RJDWz4HcCS7WgVrKACLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DzU0QLWHz-g/YDaif6PUGQI/AAAAAAAAq1s/3IuQWRfLh00s_fm5RJDWz4HcCS7WgVrKACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/fighter.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a class from the inimitable &lt;a href=&#34;https://dungeonantology.com/&#34;&gt;Jojiro&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://jojiro.itch.io/red-box-rogues&#34;&gt;Red Box Rogues&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter what B/X source you use, this works fine with the OSE classic 4 classes or whatever.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s a B/X class, right? Warm. Safe. Comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&amp;rsquo;s say, hypothetically, for the sake of argument, that our pl*yers (base and loathsome creatures that they are) want to play something cool and interesting instead. Let&amp;rsquo;s say they want to play &lt;a href=&#34;https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2019/12/you-sprout-bouquet-of-gun-wielding-arms.html&#34;&gt;Shivas of Gunses&lt;/a&gt;. We&amp;rsquo;re using this as an example because it&amp;rsquo;s exceptionally weird, being fighter-y but also wizard-y. If you can convert this, you can convert anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Excellent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Zero:&lt;/strong&gt; Remove all the stuff you&amp;rsquo;re going to change. In this case, a complex one, we&amp;rsquo;re cutting fucking everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3hYbNoXhT1k/YDavCyrPyMI/AAAAAAAAq2E/Pba54-5pK9EyPr_lFtv5RcHfVAQ_ciQNwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3hYbNoXhT1k/YDavCyrPyMI/AAAAAAAAq2E/Pba54-5pK9EyPr_lFtv5RcHfVAQ_ciQNwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/fighter2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step one (optional):&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;If&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re combining classes, put the combined elements in there. I think Shivas of Guns should have &lt;strong&gt;Magic-User&lt;/strong&gt; experience/level and HD, since they do spells sort of; &lt;strong&gt;Thief&lt;/strong&gt; saves, armor proficiency, and prime requisite, since they&amp;rsquo;re nimble; and &lt;strong&gt;Guns&lt;/strong&gt; as a weapon proficiency, for obvious reasons. If you&amp;rsquo;re converting something that&amp;rsquo;s more obviously &amp;ldquo;just a wizard&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;just a fighter&amp;rdquo; or whatever, &lt;strong&gt;you can skip this step&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step One (Point Five):&lt;/strong&gt; This is also a good time to put the name of the class in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what we&amp;rsquo;ve got so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IMTw7CZh000/YDax0sj0heI/AAAAAAAAq2U/qagj9N8VNlwSpsFLkjbHDvU6tpoorceKQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IMTw7CZh000/YDax0sj0heI/AAAAAAAAq2U/qagj9N8VNlwSpsFLkjbHDvU6tpoorceKQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/fighter3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step Two (Mandatory):&lt;/strong&gt; Put all the abilities of the GLOG class in, converting references to &lt;strong&gt;templates&lt;/strong&gt; to references to &lt;strong&gt;level&lt;/strong&gt; as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oUwRaJjZbhk/YDa2xRotOBI/AAAAAAAAq2c/dswut10EgSUmcGqbipUB3d602AHdAoAiACLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter3.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oUwRaJjZbhk/YDa2xRotOBI/AAAAAAAAq2c/dswut10EgSUmcGqbipUB3d602AHdAoAiACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h416/fighter3.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bam! And we made a whole fancy layout that we didn&amp;rsquo;t need, even. This is a simple enough process that you can honestly just write down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SHIVA OF GUNS&lt;br&gt;
PRIME REQ:&lt;/strong&gt; DEX&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;ARMOR:&lt;/strong&gt; LEATHER, NO SHIELDS&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;WEAPONS:&lt;/strong&gt; GUNS, KNIVES&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;HD/EXP:&lt;/strong&gt; AS M-U&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;THAC0:&lt;/strong&gt; AS FIGHTER&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;SAVES:&lt;/strong&gt; AS THIEF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, for most classes you can cut that down to one line: &lt;strong&gt;STUFF:&lt;/strong&gt; AS &lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And would you look at that, we&amp;rsquo;re done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xbX6isTy1L8/YDagiOeo3LI/AAAAAAAAq1k/mlfa_9NuYz4oY_wevmYfJ1BoVt1XRxeigCLcBGAsYHQ/s813/unknown.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xbX6isTy1L8/YDagiOeo3LI/AAAAAAAAq1k/mlfa_9NuYz4oY_wevmYfJ1BoVt1XRxeigCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h368/unknown.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ten Setting Questions, Sort Of Like Scrap&#39;s</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/01/ten-setting-questions-sort-of-like.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 22 Jan 2021 20:40:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2021/01/ten-setting-questions-sort-of-like.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the distant, foreign land that is the past, &lt;a href=&#34;http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com/2014/11/this-is-not-that-list-of-questions-for.html&#34;&gt;Scrap Princess wrote a list of 20 setting questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not that list. I like that list a lot but honestly they aren&amp;rsquo;t all questions that I would ask as a player. This list &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; that - if I&amp;rsquo;m going to play in your game, I want you to answer these. I did try to channel the aesthetic of that list, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-are-the-questions&#34;&gt;Here are the questions: &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-the-questions&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) What class knows the most martial arts? Are they real martial arts like kung fu, or made up ones like krav maga?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Can I start out having already made a deal with the devil or do I have to do that in game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Do you want me to write an 8-page backstory? Can I write an 8-page backstory, if I want to? If I write something down in it like I&amp;rsquo;m the timelost princess of the brass city and the daughter of the sun and I commanded legions in the Hell War but was betrayed by my father&amp;rsquo;s vizier but I don&amp;rsquo;t know that, or that I&amp;rsquo;m elf conan and cooler than everyone else, will that be true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) If I eat someone&amp;rsquo;s heart, will I gain their powers? What about their brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) These classes are boring, can I be one from somewhere else? What about from a different system entirely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) If I make a sword, which one of us gets to name it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Am I allowed to kill the other player characters? What would I have to do to be allowed to? Do I win if I kill them all? Actually, how do I win in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) What language stands in for &amp;lsquo;Common&amp;rsquo;? Or what are we all talking to each other in? Like the party, mostly, but also everyone else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) How do I learn how to talk to rocks? No not once a day just, like, normally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Which kinds of wizards get to serve kings and live in towers and shit and which ones are run out of town or stoned to death in the streets? Can I be both? At the same time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some people have &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; answered these, incredibly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nothicseye.blogspot.com/2021/01/answering-vayras-10-setting-queustions.html&#34;&gt;Locheil&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2021/01/vayra-asks.html&#34;&gt;SunderedWorldDM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2021/01/vayra-asks.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;and-here-they-are-again-because-i-should-probably-answer-them-myself&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And here they are again, because I should probably answer them myself:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#and-here-they-are-again-because-i-should-probably-answer-them-myself&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1) What class knows the most martial arts? Are they real martial arts like kung fu, or made up ones like krav maga?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the class that knows the most made up martial arts and the most martial arts in general has to be the Templar Contemplative, or &amp;ldquo;paladin monk&amp;rdquo; if you&amp;rsquo;re crude. It&amp;rsquo;s in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain PHB&lt;/a&gt;. The one that knows the most real martial arts (historical european ones, I suppose) would be the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html&#34;&gt;FIGHTMASTER&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you count &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html&#34;&gt;BATTLEMAGES&lt;/a&gt;, I guess they each know a made up one too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2) Can I start out having already made a deal with the devil or do I have to do that in game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You could definitely argue that (true) Witches (they&amp;rsquo;re in the PHB, I&amp;rsquo;m not linking it again) have already made deals with devils, or similar beings. If you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be a Witch, you&amp;rsquo;ll have to make one with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html&#34;&gt;Satan&lt;/a&gt; in-game. You can find them at any crossroad, but only sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3) Do you want me to write an 8-page backstory? Can I write an 8-page backstory, if I want to? If I write something down in it like I&amp;rsquo;m the timelost princess of the brass city and the daughter of the sun and I commanded legions in the Hell War but was betrayed by my father&amp;rsquo;s vizier but I don&amp;rsquo;t know that, or that I&amp;rsquo;m elf conan and cooler than everyone else, will that be true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not particularly but I&amp;rsquo;d be flattered as long as you&amp;rsquo;re aware that you might die; yes sure if you&amp;rsquo;d like; the planar stuff is a no-go but elaborate backstories that set you up as a Person of Importance are totally fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4) If I eat someone&amp;rsquo;s heart, will I gain their powers? What about their brain?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they&amp;rsquo;re magic or you&amp;rsquo;re magic, probably. If they&amp;rsquo;re magic &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re magic, with 100% certainty. Spellcasters eating each others&amp;rsquo; brains for power is even in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;core rules&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5) These classes are boring, can I be one from somewhere else? What about from a different system entirely?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not if you&amp;rsquo;re the very first round of characters, I&amp;rsquo;ve invested too much in my &lt;em&gt;theme&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;tone&lt;/em&gt; to see it spurned like that. And also it would sort of ruin the &amp;lsquo;unlocking&amp;rsquo; aspect of play. If you want to see a class in the game, though, you tell me about it and I&amp;rsquo;ll tell you what you&amp;rsquo;d have to do to unlock it. I can probably adapt from anything else pretty easily, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6) If I make a sword, which one of us gets to name it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do, unless you have a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good idea. Swords are not named by their creators, they tell their creators their names. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re a god or something, then I guess you can name it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7) Am I allowed to kill the other player characters? What would I have to do to be allowed to? Do I win if I kill them all? Actually, how do I win in general?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No. You win by resolving the question of why you&amp;rsquo;re all on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and why the Sun went out, and why people get horrible visions of great birds on wings of ash and bone issuing forth from its depths and its peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8) What language stands in for &amp;lsquo;Common&amp;rsquo;? Or what are we all talking to each other in? Like the party, mostly, but also everyone else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trader&amp;rsquo;s Cant, a sort of pidgin tongue that everyone who is anyone knows how to speak. Not great for complex wordplay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9) How do I learn how to talk to rocks? No not once a day just, like, normally?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have an intelligence bonus, you can start out with that. Well, not rocks specifically, they&amp;rsquo;re too stupid. But there&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;language&lt;/a&gt; for gems and treasure, and one for swords, and one for bugs, and&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t have an intelligence bonus you can probably still learn, but it&amp;rsquo;d be more of an undertaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10) Which kinds of wizards get to serve kings and live in towers and shit and which ones are run out of town or stoned to death in the streets? Can I be both? At the same time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are proper Wizards back in the civilized lands, I think, but you can&amp;rsquo;t be one of those, you&amp;rsquo;re too poor and crazy to be one and/or they&amp;rsquo;re too sane and well-compensated to come to the Mountain. Your options are Witches, which are solidly in the &amp;ldquo;run out of town&amp;rdquo; category, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html&#34;&gt;BATTLEMAGES&lt;/a&gt;, which probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be run out of town but who&amp;rsquo;s gonna do it, huh?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>De Luminaria Minora Caelestis Hierarchiae, Or: A Young Cleric&#39;s Illustrated Primer</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/12/de-luminare-minus-caelestis-hierarchia.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 25 Dec 2020 10:30:00 -0800</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/12/de-luminare-minus-caelestis-hierarchia.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and cometh down from the Father of Lights.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angels&lt;/strong&gt;, as we well know, are the servants of some vast and defunct celestial bureaucracy, in which each of them had some important role to play. Through &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html&#34;&gt;the wearing of a mask and adherence to certain tenets&lt;/a&gt;, they may be commanded through the use of &lt;strong&gt;miracle dice&lt;/strong&gt;. The names of some &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; are known to many - &lt;em&gt;Hallow, Lightning, Kindle, Iconoclasm, Hold&lt;/em&gt; - but what of the others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a gift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alter Self&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: self D: [sum] hours&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She appears as a delinquent bohemian, carrying a palette and a bottle of wine which she drinks from continually. Her wings are stained with a rainbow of paint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are physically transformed into another person or creature of a similar type to your normal form. You acquire the gross physical qualities of your new form (movement capabilities, natural armor or weapons, presence or absence of wings, number of extremities) but she cannot grant you any &lt;strong&gt;supernal&lt;/strong&gt; powers. If more than one &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; is invested, your clothing and equipment are likewise transformed. &lt;em&gt;Alter Self&lt;/em&gt; is a sufficiently skilled artist to accurately duplicate the appearance of a specific individual, provided she has a reference to work from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Earthquake&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: 400&amp;rsquo; T: a [dice] * 20&amp;rsquo; radius sphere D: [sum] rounds&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is huge, naked, incredibly muscular.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An intense but highly localized tremor rips through the affected area, collapsing structures and cracking the earth. Creatures within the affected area fall &lt;strong&gt;prone&lt;/strong&gt; and cannot move, attack, or cast spells for the duration. &lt;em&gt;Earthquake&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo;s strength is sufficient to destroy any structure or natural feature not constructed primarily from flexible materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fusillade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: self D: [sum] rounds&lt;br&gt;
_She has an indeterminate number of arms. Attempting to count them causes migraines. Commonly associated with Black clerics.&lt;br&gt;
_Overlays herself onto your body, allowing you to hold and make attacks with up to [dice] additional firearms per round for the duration. In addition, firearms you hold are automatically and immediately reloaded with magical ammunition until [sum] bullets have been produced. The magical ammunition does not persist beyond the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: 30&amp;rsquo; T: any number of living things capable of hearing D: immediate&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is dressed like an accountant, and has gentle features. Historically associated with Green &lt;strong&gt;clerics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Targets who hear her name &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; or die instantly. On a successful &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;, they instead take [sum] damage. &lt;em&gt;Kill&lt;/em&gt; cannot be commanded without speaking her name aloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legend Lore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: something of legendary importance D: [lowest] hours&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;He appears old, bearded, and sagacious, walks with a cane and wears an elaborately decorated cap. Commonly associated with Red &lt;strong&gt;clerics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Returns at the end of the duration with [dice] pieces of information about an important person, place, or thing. If the target is present when you command him, the information will be accurate, specific, and relevant; if you have only detailed information on the target, the information will be less specific but sufficient to assist you in finding it; and if you have nothing but a name or a rumor the information will be vague and incomplete legends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Locate City&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: a circular area around the caster with a radius of [sum]*[dice] miles D: immediate&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She wears a pair of heavy earmuffs and carries a large suitcase and a map. She speaks unbidden and is invariably genocidal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Locates the nearest settlement within range (as defined by the amount of time it would take to travel there through means currently available to you) of a minimum population defined by you at the time you command her, and displays to you its position, name (translated from the language of its inhabitants as best she can), and the shortest passable route to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;d.m. Locate City has a sister, who appears identical save for some small difference such as webbed hands and feet or incongruous facial hair. Her sister&amp;rsquo;s power is to destroy the entire targeted area in an explosion of concussive force and bitter cold.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Might&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: self D: [sum] rounds&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She appears as an archon of vengeance in full harness of elaborately filigreed plate, and bears a massive and equally ornamented sword.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are wreathed in glimmering &lt;strong&gt;supernal&lt;/strong&gt; armor which doubles your &lt;strong&gt;strength&lt;/strong&gt; bonus, renders you immune to normal weapons, and allows each attack you make against an opponent of [dice] or lesser &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; to automatically hit and deal maximum damage for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shillelagh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: a blunt object D: [sum] hours or until discharged&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is wild-haired, painted in woad, and carries a large knife at her belt.&lt;/em&gt;_ Commonly associated with Blue &lt;strong&gt;clerics&lt;/strong&gt;._&lt;br&gt;
The target strikes with incredible force for the duration, is able to harm &lt;strong&gt;demons&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;elfs&lt;/strong&gt;, and the &lt;strong&gt;undead&lt;/strong&gt; as though it were made of appropriate materials, and deals double damage for the next [dice] blows you strike with it. Charges are not expended on missed attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: earshot T: 5&amp;rsquo;^[dice] radius centered around a creature, object, or point D: [sum] minutes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She wears a ski mask and dark clothing, but carries herself with a regal bearing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Complete magical silence blankets the affected area. All sound is stopped: Conversation and further command of &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; is impossible, and no noise whatsoever issues from, enters, or passes through the space. If centered around a creature or object, the area of effect moves with it; if centered around a point in space, it is stationary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Solitude&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: 120&amp;rsquo; T: something that can see and hear D: permanent or [sum] rounds, see text&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Her head is shrouded in bandages, and she hovers without use of her wings. Commonly associated with Yellow &lt;strong&gt;clerics&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If [sum]*2 is greater than or equal to the target&amp;rsquo;s current &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; and they fail a &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt;, they are struck blind and/or deaf (your choice) until you direct &lt;em&gt;Solitude&lt;/em&gt; to release her hold on them. If [sum]*2 is less than their &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; or the &lt;strong&gt;save&lt;/strong&gt; is successful, her effect lasts only [sum] rounds instead. &lt;em&gt;Solitude&lt;/em&gt; can be commanded with only her name, i.e. even if your hands are bound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: a creature or object D: [sum] hours or until discharged&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is tall and appears carved from marble.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The warded target hardens and takes on the rough texture of stone, protecting it from the next [sum] points of damage it would suffer. If placed in a situation where survival is impossible (immersed in lava, thrown off the Face of the world, &amp;amp;c) they immediately turn to invulnerable stone and lose consciousness. If this occurs, &lt;em&gt;Stoneskin&lt;/em&gt; is incapable of reversing the transformation herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: 120&amp;rsquo; T: [dice] 10&amp;rsquo; x 10&amp;rsquo; panels in contiguous formation D: instant&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She is broad-shouldered, carrying a variety of tools in a leather belt, and requires specific instructions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Creates a wall in the target area, with a thickness dependent on material. The area must be relatively clear of obstructions; &lt;em&gt;Wall&lt;/em&gt; refuses to move objects for you and strict safety standards prevent her from working on areas that currently contain living beings. If directed by another &lt;strong&gt;angel&lt;/strong&gt; with knowledge of architecture, she can produce double the amount of material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;d.m. various Walls exist, each producing a different material when commanded. Wall of Stone is commonly associated with White clerics, and Wind Wall was historically associated with the Orange heretics before their extinction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zone of Truth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: a 20&amp;rsquo; radius around you D: [sum] minutes&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;She carries a long staff topped with an ostrich feather, and refuses to speak.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
For the duration, knowingly spoken untruths can be seen as streams of ephemerally glowing fog where they cross the &lt;strong&gt;Zone&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Drink-sharing Rituals</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-10th-drink-sharing-rituals.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2020 14:01:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-10th-drink-sharing-rituals.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;, which never ended in our hearts! Here&amp;rsquo;s a social mechanic stolen in its entirety from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cavesofqud.fandom.com/wiki/Water_Ritual&#34;&gt;Caves of Qud&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I9NtNVX7R3k/X6hywpoaw6I/AAAAAAAAqaU/lesq6RtPMogzZzy5MNabMssnfdcGFai5gCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I9NtNVX7R3k/X6hywpoaw6I/AAAAAAAAqaU/lesq6RtPMogzZzy5MNabMssnfdcGFai5gCLcBGAsYHQ/w427-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A ratman drinking tea, probably.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;rituals-tea-and-otherwise&#34;&gt;Rituals, Tea and Otherwise &lt;a href=&#34;#rituals-tea-and-otherwise&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, you know the standard reaction table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5TwCHEaViA0/X6hsw8cl70I/AAAAAAAAqaI/vz7hfU8-lKoqP7OFkplTA32-xnDU9A83gCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-5TwCHEaViA0/X6hsw8cl70I/AAAAAAAAqaI/vz7hfU8-lKoqP7OFkplTA32-xnDU9A83gCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h127/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This, more or less. 2d6+CHA mod of most visible PC/whoever is attempting to lead the negotiation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When faced with an encounter that is capable of communicating with the party and not &lt;em&gt;immediately and violently&lt;/em&gt; hostile (i.e. had a reaction result higher than 2), any player can walk forward bearing a waterskin or other recognizable drink container and declare that they will attempt the drink-sharing ritual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drink-sharing ritual is universally understood, and has eight steps (an auspicious number):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, you drink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you offer them the beverage and they drink. If you&amp;rsquo;re attempting the ritual with something that can&amp;rsquo;t drink, pouring the beverage over them is an acceptable substitute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;ve drugged the drink, that takes effect as normal. If they figure it out, expect combat and to be attacked on sight by any other members of the faction should one survive to speak of your crimes - the drink-sharing ritual is sacred.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you offer them something. This can be a material &lt;strong&gt;gift&lt;/strong&gt; (everyone loves treasure and/or interesting tchotchkes) or a &lt;strong&gt;secret&lt;/strong&gt; (everyone loves gossip and rumors).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you offer a &lt;strong&gt;secret&lt;/strong&gt; then you are honor-bound to not give that same secret to anyone else in a drink-sharing ritual. Probably nothing is &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; stopping you from doing so, but the idea is repellent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, you ask for something in return. Decide if you ask for a &lt;strong&gt;secret&lt;/strong&gt;, a &lt;strong&gt;gift&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, reroll the reaction check (&lt;strong&gt;2d6+CHA mod&lt;/strong&gt; of character performing the ritual) plus the following modifiers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; if you shared a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-6th-mountaineering-rations-of.html&#34;&gt;drink more impressive to the other party than water&lt;/a&gt;. Beer, nice tea, liquor, etc. Different participants are impressed by different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; if the &lt;strong&gt;gift&lt;/strong&gt; you offered was especially appreciated. Different participants appreciate different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; if you asked for &lt;strong&gt;nothing&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you asked for a &lt;strong&gt;secret&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;gift&lt;/strong&gt; and rolled &lt;strong&gt;Friendly (9+)&lt;/strong&gt; or higher, they give it to you. What they actually give you will depend on what they know/what they have as well as their initial reaction result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you asked for nothing, the new reaction result replaces the initial one if it&amp;rsquo;s higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then the ritual is complete and you&amp;rsquo;re back to normal, non-structured social interaction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There you go. Sort of a risk-mitigating mechanic for when you meet some Unfriendly &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-b-is-for-beastman-races.html&#34;&gt;ratmen&lt;/a&gt; and need to get past them or whatever, at the cost of some tea and maybe a secret. I hope this is useful to at least one person!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Orcs, River and Otherwise</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-9th-orcs-river-and-otherwise.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 09 Oct 2020 23:29:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-9th-orcs-river-and-otherwise.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Perhaps a month of posts was too ambitious. Ah, well, nevertheless: GLOG is about breaking the rules, and thus I shall finish GLOGtober as though it never ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-civilized-lands&#34;&gt;The Civilized Lands &lt;a href=&#34;#the-civilized-lands&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Civilized Lands, from whence adventurers come to &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html&#34;&gt;the Mountain,&lt;/a&gt; are dominated by two large culture-groups, each formed from several component polities. They are the &lt;strong&gt;River Kingdoms,&lt;/strong&gt; an imperial federation that originated in the homelands of the orcs, and the &lt;strong&gt;Charter Nations&lt;/strong&gt;, a more loosely organized alliance and trade group that originated in the homelands of the goblinoids. Today, we are concerned with the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BRf7Buj0KhI/X6eiVb_TopI/AAAAAAAAqYk/PMmDEA-zzAoM4JzdPK1So17ZdJcX9pO7QCLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-BRf7Buj0KhI/X6eiVb_TopI/AAAAAAAAqYk/PMmDEA-zzAoM4JzdPK1So17ZdJcX9pO7QCLcBGAsYHQ/w555-h640/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hill orc warrior.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;orcs&#34;&gt;Orcs &lt;a href=&#34;#orcs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about orcs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Orc:  Tall and universally muscular, with strong brows, jutting lower jaws with protruding tusks, and pointed ears. There are three races of orc: Hill, water, and “half”—the lattermost of which would more properly be termed “mountain orcs”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Hill orc:  Green skin, approximately seven feet tall, +1 STR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Water orc: Heavy-set, gray-brown to blue-gray skin, bulbous milky eyes, webbed extremities, gills set into necks and faces, just under seven feet tall. Amphibious (swim speed equal to land speed, breathe water as well as air), see well in dim light, disadvantage in sunlight, +1 STR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Half-orc:  Pale yellow, green, or gray skin, about six and a half feet tall. “Half-orc” is a (derogatory) misnomer applied due to relative size, +1 to a stat of your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orc social systems and biology are closer to our own than those of &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-3rd-goblins-of-civilized-lands.html&#34;&gt;goblinoids&lt;/a&gt;, so I don&amp;rsquo;t think I need to spend as many words on them. Hill orcs are the ones you probably think of first when you think &amp;lsquo;orc&amp;rsquo; - big, green, etc. This is by design, of course - the imperial dynasty is of hill orcish origin, and by tradition members of the Imperial Court are selected from among the population of the majority-hill-orcish provinces at the empire&amp;rsquo;s heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hill orc knight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-river-kingdoms&#34;&gt;The River Kingdoms &lt;a href=&#34;#the-river-kingdoms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The River Kingdoms are a federated empire of provinces (with governors appointed directly by the empress) and vassal and tributary states (under suzerainty of the Imperial Court). They are innumerable and ever-changing in size and import, but we can talk about the Imperial Core itself as a group as well as the four vassal states most currently relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Imperial Core&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eight largest and most powerful provinces at the heart of the empire, the wellspring from which its might and glory spread throughout the civilized lands in ages past. The Imperial Core covers such an enormous amount of land that it is difficult to characterize its climate or geography; it ranges from temperate plains, forest, mountain, and steppe in the north to subtropical jungle and coastline in the south. Majority hill orc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mondal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A large archipelago kingdom, tropical and subtropical in climate with some mountainous regions temperate by way of altitude. One of the most important vassals of the Imperial Court for much of its history, providing a great portion of its food and art imports and respected as such in the Imperial Core. Majority water orc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ked&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A smaller vassal kingdom and buffer state between the Imperial Core and its neighboring powers, located along a coastline and stretching inward along several major river tributaries. Ked provides a greater proportion of its population to the imperial army than any other River Kingdom, and several of its people hold high generalships. Majority water orc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yema&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
An empire in its own right, laying claim to a storied history nearly as long and rich as that of the River Kingdoms as a whole. An island nation far removed from the Imperial Core, it occupies a special place in the complex diplomatic structure of the empire as a nominal ally rather than vassal or tributary. Majority mountain or &amp;ldquo;half&amp;rdquo;-orc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sybia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A recently-acquired imperial possession - a state of affairs which few expect to last, as the mountainous region is a historical enemy of the River Kingdoms and has been subjugated before only to re-achieve independence in a long and bloody cycle of warfare and revolution. Majority hill orc.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mysteries and Baited Hooks</title>

      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Oct 2020 12:12:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-8th-mysteries-and-baited-hooks.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we&amp;rsquo;ve got the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html&#34;&gt;Ranger Made of Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, but absolutely no idea who, what, or why they are&amp;hellip; That&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;em&gt;mystery.&lt;/em&gt; It counts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lsOMGKwKNHo/X4Iocvo8-zI/AAAAAAAAqOY/riKJODZa3-QDlnnLWsfPpYzDV_2jpdSBwCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/hookranger2.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lsOMGKwKNHo/X4Iocvo8-zI/AAAAAAAAqOY/riKJODZa3-QDlnnLWsfPpYzDV_2jpdSBwCLcBGAsYHQ/w480-h640/hookranger2.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-rangery&#34;&gt;The Rangery &lt;a href=&#34;#the-rangery&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Ranger&amp;rsquo; is an in-world title. Rangers are somewhat like a secret society, somewhat like a freelance intelligence agency. They exist in the largest cities and the most distant wastes; naturally, many of them have found their way to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All Rangers are &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html&#34;&gt;Made of Hooks&lt;/a&gt;, transformed into that shape through some arcane ritual initiation that has never been witnessed by an outsider. Perhaps there is an indoctrination component, some element of the process that turns double-agents into triple-agents and prevents them from betraying the Rangery. Or perhaps the ones that can&amp;rsquo;t be turned are detected and quietly killed and replaced - after all, it would be hard to identify them once their body has been transformed into a knot of barbed and twisted iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html&#34;&gt;Satans&lt;/a&gt;, you should add Rangers to all your encounter tables, maybe opposite the Satan (boxcars?). They can appear anywhere. They shouldn&amp;rsquo;t really be directly hostile unless you&amp;rsquo;re _fucking _with them, so take reaction rolls on that end of the spectrum to mean that their purposes are orthogonal to yours and likely in conflict.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They make camps, small chambers of comfort deep in the underground or high on the face. They stock these camps with weapons and provisions, everything crafted solely from locally available materials. The entrances are very well-hidden, but should you find one uninhabited you are welcome to make use of everything within; if the Ranger had not wanted you to find it, you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have done so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html&#34;&gt;Ranger Made of Hooks&lt;/a&gt; if you meet a friendly one and accept and complete a quest**&lt;em&gt;mystery&lt;/em&gt;** for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;1d20-ranger-mysteries&#34;&gt;1d20 Ranger Mysteries &lt;a href=&#34;#1d20-ranger-mysteries&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What lies at the heart of the Sun?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take this ball of fishhooks to the mouth of Hell, anchor the line nearby, and throw it in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What was the cause of the War that sundered the world?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring me the crown of a last king of giants.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who blinded the leeches?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Burn the homes of the mushroom-folk.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who were the Brothers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make peace between the ratmen and the bat men.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the meaning of the word &amp;rsquo;elf&amp;rsquo;?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cast this barbed spear from the top of the Mountain or higher, and have it land in the sea.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the source of G_d&amp;rsquo;s power?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Plant this fishhook in the flesh of the Rune King.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who is or was the Traitor?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open the path from the cradle to the top of the Mountain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Who survives of the Red Court?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Poison the blood pits.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the purpose of the Rangers?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring a colony of mushroom-folk to the surface of the moon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Where lives the oldest whale?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bring the richest denizen of the catacombs before the Sun to face judgement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Adventure! (Class: Ranger)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2020 22:18:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-7th-adventure-class-ranger.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;definitions-and-etymology&#34;&gt;Definitions and Etymology &lt;a href=&#34;#definitions-and-etymology&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, the term &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo;. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t normally - in real life - mean walking into a tomb and killing (or being killed by) skeletons, getting treasure, all the things we expect from a tabletop RPG &amp;ldquo;adventure&amp;rdquo;. It really just means, like, going somewhere. The &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt;, that&amp;rsquo;s the adventure, the exciting part. What you do when you actually get there is just&amp;hellip; Work, usually. Sometimes hanging out. With the &lt;em&gt;bros&lt;/em&gt;. But usually just work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oSXpYXXQw2c/X3_0VlK-BkI/AAAAAAAAqM4/qmozRAiM3lQWPOH_GZcKrX8IsSoNhjHXACLcBGAsYHQ/image.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-oSXpYXXQw2c/X3_0VlK-BkI/AAAAAAAAqM4/qmozRAiM3lQWPOH_GZcKrX8IsSoNhjHXACLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/image.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image disagrees with me, but fuck it. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t know&lt;/em&gt; anything_. It&amp;rsquo;s just an image._&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forget where I was going with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know who goes on adventures? Rangers. And you know what you need for adventures? Hooks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all &lt;em&gt;fits together,&lt;/em&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t you &lt;em&gt;see&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vP1pK5e4C8U/X4D8vY_H-AI/AAAAAAAAqN0/diA9t7RsFwEpgduvGQcWziQh-BWhzErTwCLcBGAsYHQ/s2048/hookranger.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vP1pK5e4C8U/X4D8vY_H-AI/AAAAAAAAqN0/diA9t7RsFwEpgduvGQcWziQh-BWhzErTwCLcBGAsYHQ/w283-h400/hookranger.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;ranger-made-of-hooks&#34;&gt;Ranger Made of Hooks &lt;a href=&#34;#ranger-made-of-hooks&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/A: Bushcraft, Ankomorph&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**2/B: Trailblazing, Wilderness Lore&lt;br&gt;
****3/C: Barbs, Ranging, Fishhook&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;strong&gt;4/D: Ambush, Skyhook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Bushcraft&lt;/strong&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;bushcraft&lt;/strong&gt;, and can easily make mundane objects out of natural resources such as sticks, rocks, and plant matter which function nearly as well as professionally made versions. This takes &lt;strong&gt;ten minutes&lt;/strong&gt; for anything portable (torches, a short rope, snares, spears, etc), or &lt;strong&gt;one hour&lt;/strong&gt; for vehicles or structures (shelters, pit traps, rafts, sledges, etc). This isn&amp;rsquo;t infinite free gear - you and your GM should work together to describe what exactly you do to make whatever things you&amp;rsquo;re making - but it is as much free gear and as &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; of free gear as is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A: Ankomorph&lt;br&gt;
**In place of flesh, your body is comprised of thousands upon thousands of iron fishhooks, knotted together into barbed, twisting appendages in rough facsimile of an orcish or goblinoid form. This renders you immune to most concerns of fleshier beings such as disease and poison, although you do still require sustenance and have to be wary of rust and lodestones. Their natural hardness gives you **4 AC **that doesn&amp;rsquo;t stack with armor, and your &lt;strong&gt;unarmed attacks&lt;/strong&gt; and successful &lt;strong&gt;grapple&lt;/strong&gt; checks deal **1d6 **base damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Trailblazing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;tracking&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;pathfinding&lt;/strong&gt;. Yourself and your party are not slowed by rough terrain during overland travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Wilderness Lore&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When encountering a strange plant or animal for the first time, you have a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of identifying them. When encountering a condition (a disease, poison, curse, enchantment, etc) for the first time, you have a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of knowing of a strange plant or animal that could affect that condition in some way (causing it, curing it, immunizing against it, etc). When learning of or entering a notable location for the first time, you have a &lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of deducing an &lt;strong&gt;adventure hook&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;rumor&lt;/strong&gt; with at least one true element for that location from context clues and prior information. These chances improve by &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; per Ranger Made of Hooks template, to a maximum of &lt;strong&gt;4-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; at template D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Barbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you successfully hit with an &lt;strong&gt;unarmed attack&lt;/strong&gt;, you can make another &lt;strong&gt;unarmed attack&lt;/strong&gt; against the same target with no penalty and without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;. This continues until you miss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Ranging&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your first random encounter each day always includes, contains, or consists of the following, &lt;em&gt;in some form&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dense vegetation (forest, plain, savanna, jungle):&lt;/strong&gt; Enough food and water for your entire party.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Sparse vegetation (desert, steppe, tundra, scrubland):&lt;/strong&gt; Enough food and water for yourself and four others.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;No vegetation (dungeon, glacier, salt flat):&lt;/strong&gt; Enough food and water for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Fishhook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have, somehow, acquired a fish friend. It is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-c-is-for-cave-beasts-companions.html&#34;&gt;giant cave pike&lt;/a&gt;, who despite its ill temper and tiny brain considers you its best pal in the entire world and will do its best to defend you. It possesses a preternatural ability to find you if and when you abandon it, and will do so eventually even if slain. Or maybe that&amp;rsquo;s a different fish, then. Hard to tell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Ambush&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you begin an encounter and aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt;, you may retroactively decide where to have placed yourself and any members of your party that agree to follow your direction. At least one member must be visible and out of hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Skyhook&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your hooks reverberate with minute variations in frequency, allowing you to predict what the next change in the weather will be by standing outside and concentrating for one minute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;rations-of-the-mountain&#34;&gt;Rations of the Mountain &lt;a href=&#34;#rations-of-the-mountain&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, so you&amp;rsquo;ve taken ship to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, you&amp;rsquo;ve arrived at &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-tale-of-two-citiesit-takes.html&#34;&gt;one of the Two Cities&lt;/a&gt;, and you&amp;rsquo;re about to head inland or underground on a Grand Adventure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What the fuck kind of food do you bring with you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;1d10-rations-available-in-the-old-city&#34;&gt;1d10 Rations available in the Old City &lt;a href=&#34;#1d10-rations-available-in-the-old-city&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Or, &amp;ldquo;What are these River Kingdom troops eating?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Tea, compressed and molded into cakes (discs) or bricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;**2. **Sesame- or poppy-seed bagels, strung on a piece of cord and carried around the neck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6DLdsr3ZCM0/X34-YBLhBNI/AAAAAAAAqKI/SFNKoIZY_6ssel7NQStO_Frt9QZ8JA9EwCLcBGAsYHQ/s484/2165137-429d62249d60ba26.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6DLdsr3ZCM0/X34-YBLhBNI/AAAAAAAAqKI/SFNKoIZY_6ssel7NQStO_Frt9QZ8JA9EwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/2165137-429d62249d60ba26.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**3. **Pre-fried rice, millet, and/or wheat flour, eaten as a porridge - or straight, in an emergency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yk_CnZJ-BsM/X34_RGjYYGI/AAAAAAAAqKY/HsNNyGd-MVk0RnCbwtBOTE0I_onDJy1pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s626/pickled-green-chinese-cabbage-dish_28549-127.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Yk_CnZJ-BsM/X34_RGjYYGI/AAAAAAAAqKY/HsNNyGd-MVk0RnCbwtBOTE0I_onDJy1pgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/pickled-green-chinese-cabbage-dish_28549-127.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I do think it&amp;rsquo;s useful to know what the &amp;ldquo;rations&amp;rdquo; you bring with you up the Mountain or into the dungeon are, though. Like, if you&amp;rsquo;re carrying a big jar of olive oil, that might come in handy for things other than eating it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain Topography</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Oct 2020 00:47:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-5th-mountain-topography.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Bit of a cop-out, but I&amp;rsquo;ve gotta catch up to &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt; and I have a map of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt; that I haven&amp;rsquo;t posted yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s not this one, the side-view point map hastily scribbled on a piece of paper:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/4aAuZC8.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P0uIC_ao1u4/Xsc1DCLu8WI/AAAAAAAApR4/GwtFCfWUfg8p12NrhMpjtOveZp6mjPQcwCK4BGAsYHg/w640-h461/themountain.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;clicc for big, but I&amp;rsquo;ve already posted this one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; this one, a topographical map:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KO9bPyhm6S4/X31yWnZXUBI/AAAAAAAAqJE/NoL1N9AsmU0Jkdo34yVUHmGqQOU5TkGpgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1800/mountain.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KO9bPyhm6S4/X31yWnZXUBI/AAAAAAAAqJE/NoL1N9AsmU0Jkdo34yVUHmGqQOU5TkGpgCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h426/mountain.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;clicc for big, this one is new.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was created for me ages ago by &lt;a href=&#34;https://madcartographer.com/&#34;&gt;kahva&lt;/a&gt; and I never did anything with it, but I really like it. I suppose it&amp;rsquo;ll be especially useful if and when I need to do some overland travel bits in a game. I&amp;rsquo;ve added the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-tale-of-two-citiesit-takes.html&#34;&gt;two cities&lt;/a&gt; myself with very little consideration - their positions aren&amp;rsquo;t final.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>BATTLEMAGES (Class: Fighter but also Wizard)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 04 Oct 2020 00:13:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;! Still playing catch-up, but here&amp;rsquo;s your &lt;strong&gt;swirling rainbow vortices&lt;/strong&gt; post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we have to talk about &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CljmTPuXpeI/X3uJUotYXCI/AAAAAAAAqII/dWIWWKVHlKsBtorHKXtSRq-ZGsoII2Z_QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1100/d5zg6ny-f1a78d07-55f4-4886-821e-877d427018cf.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CljmTPuXpeI/X3uJUotYXCI/AAAAAAAAqII/dWIWWKVHlKsBtorHKXtSRq-ZGsoII2Z_QCLcBGAsYHQ/w290-h400/d5zg6ny-f1a78d07-55f4-4886-821e-877d427018cf.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CljmTPuXpeI/X3uJUotYXCI/AAAAAAAAqII/dWIWWKVHlKsBtorHKXtSRq-ZGsoII2Z_QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1100/d5zg6ny-f1a78d07-55f4-4886-821e-877d427018cf.jpg&#34;&gt;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CljmTPuXpeI/X3uJUotYXCI/AAAAAAAAqII/dWIWWKVHlKsBtorHKXtSRq-ZGsoII2Z_QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1100/d5zg6ny-f1a78d07-55f4-4886-821e-877d427018cf.jpg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;battlefire&#34;&gt;BATTLEFIRE &lt;a href=&#34;#battlefire&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;I mentioned it first a bit earlier, in &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-on-fire-elements-and-old-gods.html&#34;&gt;this cosmology (sort of) post.&lt;/a&gt; If fire is the purest representation of Man&amp;rsquo;s dominion over Nature, &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt; is the purest representation of &lt;em&gt;violence.&lt;/em&gt; It could also be described reasonably as a &lt;strong&gt;swirling rainbow vortex.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you wield &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, you have a pool of &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE Dice, Exploding,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;BDE,&lt;/strong&gt; which are &lt;strong&gt;d6&lt;/strong&gt;s.It starts at &lt;strong&gt;zero&lt;/strong&gt; and you get &lt;strong&gt;1 BDE&lt;/strong&gt; every time you kill something. You can hold &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; equal to your level (max. 4), and they expire whenever you take a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you deal damage, you can expend as many of your &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; as you want in order to roll them and add the &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; to your damage - in fact, you have to roll the better of your &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; to not expend any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; that roll a 6 &lt;strong&gt;explode&lt;/strong&gt; both mechanically and narratively, dealing their damage to everything within a &lt;strong&gt;5&amp;rsquo; radius&lt;/strong&gt; (including you, increasing by &lt;strong&gt;5&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; for each 6 rolled, with a &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half) and adding another &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; to the roll, which can also &lt;strong&gt;explode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt; damage always counts as the most advantageous damage type; bludgeoning against skeletons and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-b-is-for-beastman-races.html&#34;&gt;leeches,&lt;/a&gt; holy fire against &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html&#34;&gt;Satans,&lt;/a&gt; cold against &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-d-is-for-dragons.html&#34;&gt;dragons,&lt;/a&gt; et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**BATTLEFIRE **is most commonly wielded by &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEMAGES&lt;/strong&gt;, but the secrets of its containment can also be taught to &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html&#34;&gt;Fighter-types&lt;/a&gt; who have achieved utter mastery of their craft (in game terms, reached fourth level).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vhVOAsBiWQs/X3uKG0lYiHI/AAAAAAAAqIU/aqMdzW0EoJE88dSHwAsFShOS8Znz7c4KwCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/8eDE8s.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;[&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vhVOAsBiWQs/X3uKG0lYiHI/AAAAAAAAqIU/aqMdzW0EoJE88dSHwAsFShOS8Znz7c4KwCLcBGAsYHQ/w300-h400/8eDE8s.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vhVOAsBiWQs/X3uKG0lYiHI/AAAAAAAAqIU/aqMdzW0EoJE88dSHwAsFShOS8Znz7c4KwCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/8eDE8s.jpg&#34;&gt;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vhVOAsBiWQs/X3uKG0lYiHI/AAAAAAAAqIU/aqMdzW0EoJE88dSHwAsFShOS8Znz7c4KwCLcBGAsYHQ/s800/8eDE8s.jpg&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;battlemages&#34;&gt;BATTLEMAGES &lt;a href=&#34;#battlemages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every type of &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEMAGE&lt;/strong&gt; wields &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, as per the above. All &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEMAGE&lt;/strong&gt;s are &lt;strong&gt;spellcasters&lt;/strong&gt;, but cast spells with &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt;instead of &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt;and any damage dealt by them is &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;damage. When used to cast a spell, &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; still work as normal - always expended, replenished through murder, &lt;strong&gt;explode&lt;/strong&gt; on 6s, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;whole bunch&lt;/em&gt; of classes. They are very combat focused. I might do these in sort of a microclass format, because holy hell are there ever a lot of them. &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEMAGES&lt;/strong&gt; start with normal starting gear for a Wizard-type character plus one or two weird things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; An executioner&amp;rsquo;s hood, and a headsman&amp;rsquo;s axe that can wound ghosts and spirits and deals full damage to undead. The axe is cursed to never leave the &lt;strong&gt;AXEORCIST&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; side, and will reappear in their possession within 24 hours even if utterly destroyed. The curse is tied to the &lt;strong&gt;AXEORCIST&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/strong&gt; soul, and cannot be removed without killing the &lt;strong&gt;AXEORCIST&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;AXEORCIST&lt;/strong&gt;, count your &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; as one higher when attacking with axes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You can smell undead, and sense what type of magic raised them. Mindless undead roll &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; as if they had a fear-response when fighting you.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Your axe-blows dispel magic and banish possession. When you kill something, it can&amp;rsquo;t be raised as undead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; While reciting a litany of &lt;strong&gt;AXEORCISM&lt;/strong&gt;, you cannot be touched by the undead. You can make one extra attack per round with no penalty.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; If you ever die, you will return as an &lt;strong&gt;AXE REVENANT&lt;/strong&gt;, animated by &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;. If you &lt;strong&gt;AXEORCISE&lt;/strong&gt; 13 other undead before the next full moon without dying again, you will return to life - if you fail, your cursed axe will behead you itself.&lt;/p&gt;

ENCHANTERMINATOR also known as MAN-AT-CHARMS &lt;a href=&#34;#2-enchanterminator-also-known-as-man-at-charms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stolen from &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; An iron mask bolted and locked to your skull, which provides protection as a &lt;strong&gt;full helm&lt;/strong&gt;. Two ghost-bottles containing the spells &lt;em&gt;suggestion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;charm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Suggestion&lt;br&gt;
R:&lt;/strong&gt; 10&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; a single intelligence &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; instantaneous &lt;strong&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; Charisma partial, see text&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burns a thought, idea, concept, or belief into the subject&amp;rsquo;s mind with &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE.&lt;/strong&gt; The scale at which it can operate is determined by the number of &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; invested:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coherent single thoughts.&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;ldquo;I should kill my husband&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I should walk off this cliff&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Who even needs a king, anyway?&amp;rdquo; Unlikely to have lasting effect, but repeat castings may be disturbing for the target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Implications and complex knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; A suspicion of spousal infidelity, a sudden &lt;em&gt;ennui&lt;/em&gt; which catches you off guard, an impression that democracy is a good idea. Hard to shake off, and much more likely to stick around.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivations.&lt;/strong&gt; You are &lt;em&gt;sure&lt;/em&gt; your husband is cheating on you, you &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; you have nothing left to live for, the king is &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a murderous bastard with an army of mind-controlling torturers at his command. Deprogramming, at this stage, is difficult.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Definite knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; You caught your spouse cheating on you, and if you can find a gun you can kill the two of them before they get away. You&amp;rsquo;ve already decided to kill yourself, and now you&amp;rsquo;re searching for a nice high building so you can end it immediately. The rebellion contacted you weeks ago, and tonight at the Grand Ball the bourgeois will realize all that they have done. Deprogramming is only possible if the target survives.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A successful &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; roll negates one &lt;strong&gt;die&lt;/strong&gt; of the spell&amp;rsquo;s effect, forcing a less complete idea to be imprinted. An &lt;strong&gt;ENCHANTERMINATOR&lt;/strong&gt; is skilled enough at mental manipulation to adjust on the fly and make a new &lt;em&gt;suggestion&lt;/em&gt;, provided the spell is not entirely negated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template of &lt;strong&gt;ENCHANTERMINATOR&lt;/strong&gt;, ignore 1 point of damage from each event while under the effect of a mind-affecting enchantment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; While under the effect of a mind-affecting enchantment, you do not require food, water, or rest.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; While under the effect of a mind-affecting enchantment, count your &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; as four higher and you cannot be &lt;em&gt;slowed&lt;/em&gt; or restrained.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; While under the effect of a mind-affecting enchantment, you can sense creatures and objects within 100&amp;rsquo;. This sense is blocked by 10&amp;rsquo; of stone, 1&amp;rsquo; of wood, 1&amp;quot; of iron, or a thin sheet of lead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; While under the effect of a mind-affecting enchantment that you cast yourself, any cast on you by others are consumed utterly. If you die while enchanted, your lingering spells pilot your corpse onward for a number of days equal to your level before dissipating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; An athame, a disemboweling hook, a book of omens, a bronze reference liver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;GOREACLE,&lt;/strong&gt; gain &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; with one method of divination. The first one is, of course, always &lt;strong&gt;haruspicy&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; The blood, gore, and viscera of your fallen enemies reveals the immediate future of the battle to you. Each time you slay an opponent in melee combat, you receive &lt;strong&gt;+1 bonus to Attack, damage, and AC&lt;/strong&gt; for the remainder of the encounter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; When you slay an opponent of equal or greater &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; in single combat, you may ask the DM one yes or no question which they will answer truthfully.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; When you critically hit an opponent in melee combat, you hook out one of their intestines and read the future of their actions upon it. Your next attack against them automatically hits, or their next attack against you automatically misses, whichever occurs first. This only works on creatures with guts.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; You have learned to take trophies from those you kill, turning them into grisly runestones engraved with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://nethackwiki.com/wiki/Elbereth&#34;&gt;EIGHT-LETTER NAME&lt;/a&gt;. When you place a series of skulls so engraved within 10&amp;rsquo; of each other, creatures must roll &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; to successfully pass the lines between them or interact with them in any way. In addition, the skulls count as foes slain in melee combat for your &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; template ability if you crush them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A greatsword, a rapier, a dagger, a raven&amp;rsquo;s skull engraved with the spell &lt;em&gt;propagate curse&lt;/em&gt;, and a curse (roll a &lt;strong&gt;d6&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Propagate Curse&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; earshot &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; one creature that can both hear and see you, and one curse &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; instantaneous &lt;strong&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; Charisma partial, see text&lt;br&gt;
Copies an existing curse to the target, which makes a &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; roll to resist with &lt;strong&gt;[sum] difficulty&lt;/strong&gt;. If the target fails their &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; roll the copied curse is permanent, otherwise it fails to gain purchase on the target&amp;rsquo;s soul and dissipates in &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse of Hatred.&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed suffers a &lt;strong&gt;-2&lt;/strong&gt; penalty to &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt; rolls. Animals and things of animal intelligence attack them on sight.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse of Blight.&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed&amp;rsquo;s touch causes plants to wither and food and water to turn to rot and mud. This is enough to sustain them, barely and unpleasantly, but means they no longer recover &lt;strong&gt;hit points&lt;/strong&gt; through lunches and is probably very inconvenient in other ways as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse of Shadow.&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed is enveloped by shadow, even if outside on a sunny day or under the effect of a paladin&amp;rsquo;s Blessing. This is actually sort of a boon if they&amp;rsquo;re a sneaky type and don&amp;rsquo;t suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder or anything similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse of Failure.&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed suffers a &lt;strong&gt;critical failure&lt;/strong&gt; whenever they would normally achieve a &lt;strong&gt;critical success&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse of Ruin.&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed&amp;rsquo;s touch turns gold to lead, silver to tin, and diamonds to smoky quartz. It will have similar effect on any precious metal or stone.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Curse of BATTLEFIRE.&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed loses &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; maximum hit point per day as &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt; consumes them from the inside out. This is incredibly painful, as one might expect. In addition, if they were not previously a wielder of &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, they become one. Expending at least &lt;strong&gt;1 BDE&lt;/strong&gt; staves off the curse&amp;rsquo;s effect for that day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;HEXECUTIONER&lt;/strong&gt;, you deal an additional &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage when attacking a cursed target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You can detect magic by scent, curses by flavor, and cast curse-related spells without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; Gain a second random curse. You know the distance and direction of every target that carries a curse you have placed on them.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; Gain a third random curse. You can cast spells on targets that carry a curse you have placed on them from any range.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Gain a fourth random curse. You can instantly teleport to the location of any target that carries a curse you have placed on them, by rolling and expending &lt;strong&gt;4 BDE&lt;/strong&gt;. If any of the &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;explode&lt;/strong&gt;, they &lt;strong&gt;explode&lt;/strong&gt; at both the location you are departing and the location you are appearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Rainbow-colored round sunglasses that cause illusions to appear partially transparent and insubstantial, an extremely garish outfit, a hand mirror with the spells &lt;em&gt;illusion&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;color spray&lt;/em&gt; scratched into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;KILLUSIONIST&lt;/strong&gt; you learn one spell from the &lt;strong&gt;KILLUSIONIST&lt;/strong&gt; spell list, in order:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantasmal Killer&lt;br&gt;
R:&lt;/strong&gt; [dice] * 100&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; a nonblind creature capable of fear&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; instantaneous &lt;strong&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; Intelligence or Charisma partial&lt;br&gt;
You extract a phantasmal image of the target&amp;rsquo;s deepest fear and send it hurtling toward them. The target rolls the higher of their &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; (to recognize the illusion) or &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; (to withstand the fear): If they fail and &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; is greater than their current hit points they die of fright, or if it is lesser than their current hit points they are &lt;strong&gt;panicked&lt;/strong&gt; and must flee or cower helplessly. If they succeed, then they are &lt;strong&gt;shaken&lt;/strong&gt; and suffer &lt;strong&gt;2 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on all actions until they take a minute to calm down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nightmare&lt;br&gt;
R:&lt;/strong&gt; unlimited &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; an unconscious mind capable of fear** D:** instantaneous** S:** Charisma partial&lt;br&gt;
You infest the mind of a target (which you must be able to name and clearly picture) with hideous and terrible visions. The target must roll &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; to resist the nightmare; if they fail, they take &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage as they claw and tear at themselves in their sleep. Regardless of it they succeed or fail, they gain no benefits from any rest that was disturbed by the nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Mirror Self&lt;br&gt;
R/T: &lt;strong&gt;self&lt;/strong&gt; D: **[sum] minutes &lt;strong&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; none&lt;br&gt;
You divide yourself into &lt;strong&gt;[dice] + 1&lt;/strong&gt; quasi-real duplicates, each of which is illusory to the others but completely real to anyone else and share perceptions, thoughts, and memories. Whenever any one of you takes any damage then that one pops like a balloon and a different you was the real one, and if any of you use a magic item then that copy of the item was real and the rest were all illusory duplicates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mirror Clone&lt;br&gt;
R:&lt;/strong&gt; touch &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; a reflective surface &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; permanent &lt;strong&gt;S:&lt;/strong&gt; none&lt;br&gt;
You reach into a mirror or mirrorlike surface and retrieve &lt;strong&gt;[dice]&lt;/strong&gt; copies of anything you can see within it, which emerge at the same size as they appeared in the mirror. If animate, they have a personality that is halfway between that of a creepy ghost girl from a J-horror movie and a serial killer. Assuming you have a similar personality, you might still get along.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You can deal &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage to illusions with a touch if you choose to do so.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; You can speak with illusions - not the thing they are depicting, but the spells themselves. Illusions you cast persist for one additional minute beyond their duration, even if dispelled or dismissed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; When you touch an illusion, roll opposed &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; against its creator. If you succeed, you control the illusion now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; You can choose for illusions you are currently touching to be completely real.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A pair of brass knuckles, an umbrella.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;METEOBRAWLOGIST&lt;/strong&gt; you are immune to progressively more intense weather and environmental effects, which are detailed in the templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You are immune to discomfort due to temperature or weather, like a too-hot or too-cold day. Your fists deal &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; base damage, and inflict whatever the effect of the current weather is on the target (to scale: if it&amp;rsquo;s drizzling they get a little wet, if it&amp;rsquo;s a downpour they become soaked and possibly blasted back by the deluge).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; You are immune to long-term exposure damage from temperature or weather, like marching in 30+ degree sunlight or sleeping through a below-0 night. You can predict what the next change in the weather will be by standing outside for ten minutes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; You are immune to short-term exposure damage from temperature or weather, like being dunked in boiling water or locked in a freezer. Whenever you &lt;strong&gt;critically hit&lt;/strong&gt; or kill an opponent with an unarmed attack, you may have the DM reroll the weather (or apply the last change you predicted, if it hasn&amp;rsquo;t come to pass yet).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; You are completely immune to damage from temperature or weather, like a dragon&amp;rsquo;s fire breath or a wizard&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;cone of cold&lt;/em&gt; spell. Your fists inflict the maximum effect of whatever the current form of weather is on your targets, which deals up to &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; additional damage and may cause other problems for them based on the form that it takes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A scythe, an edgy outfit, &lt;em&gt;several&lt;/em&gt; skulls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;NECROMANSLAUGHTERER&lt;/strong&gt;, you may designate one undead you have created to retain its ability to speak and some semblance of its former personality and intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; When you kill a living creature, you can roll and expend a number of &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; equal to its &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; in order to raise it as a skeleton or zombie under your control. If your killing blow was struck with &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE&lt;/strong&gt;, it is raised automatically without further expenditure.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; You can speak to corpses - even animate ones - and learn the spell &lt;em&gt;magic missile&lt;/em&gt;, which you call &lt;em&gt;teeth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; You can heal undead at a rate of &lt;strong&gt;1 hit point&lt;/strong&gt; per round with a touch. When you strike an undead of equal or fewer &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; than you with a melee attack, it is destroyed and deals &lt;strong&gt;1 damage&lt;/strong&gt; to its creator through necromantic feedback.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; When you die, you continue to fight on as an undead until your skeleton is completely destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-7&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-7&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;8-marksmedium-also-known-as-perforacle&#34;&gt;8. MARKSMEDIUM also known as PERFORACLE &lt;a href=&#34;#8-marksmedium-also-known-as-perforacle&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://xenophonsramblings.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Xenophon of Athens&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A heavy crossbow, 20 bolts, 3 javelins, and a dagger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;MARKSMEDIUM&lt;/strong&gt;, count your &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; as one higher for ranged attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; When you hit an enemy with a ranged attack you can cast a spell on them regardless of range without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt; and any future attacks you make against them &lt;strong&gt;ignore AC&lt;/strong&gt; for the rest of the combat.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; When you kill an opponent with a ranged attack, the DM must tell you one secret they knew.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; When you hit an enemy with a ranged attack you can have it ricochet or pierce through them to any other target within &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;. Roll another attack roll against the new target; if it hits, any &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; expended or spells cast on the first target also apply to the second.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; When you kill an opponent with a ranged attack, the DM will roll your next random encounter in advance and tell you what it will be. This can stack multiple encounters into the future if you kill additional opponents before the next random encounter is triggered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-8&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-8&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;9-swordserer&#34;&gt;9. SWORDSERER &lt;a href=&#34;#9-swordserer&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stolen from &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-sword-swallower.html&#34;&gt;Squig&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A sword.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;SWORDSERER&lt;/strong&gt;, count your &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; as one higher when attacking with swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You can fight with any &lt;strong&gt;warblade&lt;/strong&gt; as if it were any other, or throw it with a range of &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; per level. If you didn&amp;rsquo;t already speak &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;swordsong&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, you do now.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; You can eat swords or sword-like objects as if they were rations.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; While wielding a &lt;strong&gt;warblade&lt;/strong&gt;, you get a &lt;strong&gt;free attack&lt;/strong&gt; against any opponent that misses you in melee.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; You are supernaturally intimidating to swords. When you attempt to threaten or bribe one, it must roll &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; or refuse to be lifted against you. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt;, and works on any &lt;strong&gt;warblade&lt;/strong&gt; within earshot that is not wielded by a &lt;strong&gt;sword witch&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-9&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-9&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;10-transmutilator-also-known-as-transflogrifier&#34;&gt;10. TRANSMUTILATOR also known as TRANSFLOGRIFIER &lt;a href=&#34;#10-transmutilator-also-known-as-transflogrifier&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A 100&amp;rsquo; spool of bonefloss (as strong as spidersilk, much less sticky), a box of titanium pins of varying length and width, 2 car batteries, a welding mask, fireproof apron and mittens, a set of jumper cables, 5 sewing needles that punch through bone effortlessly, 6 iron coat hangers, 3 old newspapers, a 120lb tank containing 10,200 litres of compressed argon gas, and an incredibly sharp scalpel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;TRANSMUTILATOR&lt;/strong&gt; you can shift up to &lt;strong&gt;two points&lt;/strong&gt; around between the four stats of any subject with a clean operating theatre and an hour&amp;rsquo;s work. This causes an amount of damage to them equal to the number of points being moved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;You have &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;anatomy&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;medicine&lt;/strong&gt;. You achieve &lt;strong&gt;critical hits&lt;/strong&gt;with melee weapons or ranged weapons within their first range increment when you would normally &lt;strong&gt;critically miss&lt;/strong&gt;, and never need to roll to perform &lt;strong&gt;surgery&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;You can tailor a creature&amp;rsquo;s bones and flesh in order to halve or double its weight, adjust its speed by &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, or produce a perfect facsimile of a different individual of its species provided you have a reference.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; You can weld new appendages, organs, et cetera that are in relatively good condition onto or into an animate body by expending &lt;strong&gt;1 BDE&lt;/strong&gt; per attachment. You roll with &lt;strong&gt;advantage&lt;/strong&gt; on mutation tables, saves against disease or poison, biomancer mishap tables, and other afflictions of the flesh, and can confer this benefit upon others for 24 hours with 1 hour of surgery.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt;You can weld a severed head onto a body to resurrect both under the head&amp;rsquo;s control, as long as neither is critically damaged or decomposed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-10&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-10&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;11-traumaturge&#34;&gt;11. TRAUMATURGE &lt;a href=&#34;#11-traumaturge&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://velvetinks.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Purplecthulhu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A broken sword, a bloody uniform, a tattered banner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;TRAUMATURGE&lt;/strong&gt;, your opponents suffer a &lt;strong&gt;-1 penalty&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You have &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;psychiatry&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;intimidation&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;discipline&lt;/strong&gt;. You can see scars through clothing and count the number of levels in Fighter-type classes someone has and the number of people they have killed by looking into their eyes. Your count might be slightly higher than true if the person has experienced other intense traumas.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; You can transfer traumatic experiences between two people with a touch. You can be one of those people. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t remove the experiences from anyone, just spreads them to more people. You can choose to enter a &lt;strong&gt;fugue state&lt;/strong&gt; at any time, becoming immune to fear and other mind-affecting effects at the cost of being unable to do anything other than &lt;strong&gt;hurt people&lt;/strong&gt; until any immediate danger or conflict has passed.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; You smell blood when a location you&amp;rsquo;re in has seen death. You can call forth the spirits of those who were killed violently at a site with 10 minutes of ritual, and give them forms of bloody phantasm which allow them to affect the material world with 10 more.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; You are skilled at exploiting the invisible links between people. When you hit an opponent with an attack, their allies within eyesight and earshot must choose to either take the same damage or flee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading-11&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading-11&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;12-warcrimelock-also-known-as-massacregician&#34;&gt;12. WARCRIMELOCK also known as MASSACREGICIAN &lt;a href=&#34;#12-warcrimelock-also-known-as-massacregician&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://oblidisideryptch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Oblidisideryptch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Notable starting equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; A briefcase containing six Walther Model 2 pocket pistols (semiautomatic, 6 round box magazine, count &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; as one lower due to no sights), 7,000 rounds of &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-modern-fiddly-firearms.html&#34;&gt;.25 ACP&lt;/a&gt; (1d6, R0), and a bloodstained note containing the spell &lt;em&gt;cloudkill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template in &lt;strong&gt;WARCRIMELOCK&lt;/strong&gt;, there is an additional very large bounty on your head and an additional party of very competent bounty hunters searching for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; You are skilled in &lt;strong&gt;explosives&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;chemistry&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;torture&lt;/strong&gt; (which is not generally an effective method of extracting information. We&amp;rsquo;ll leave it to your DM to decide what being &amp;lsquo;skilled&amp;rsquo; at it means, given that fact.) Your attacks deal an extra &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;explosive&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt; damage, your choice with each attack; when one misses, it remains in the location where it landed forever as a piece of &lt;strong&gt;potential violence&lt;/strong&gt;. Pieces of &lt;strong&gt;potential violence&lt;/strong&gt; have a &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance of detonating spontaneously when handled, dealing the same &lt;strong&gt;1d6 explosive&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt; damage.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; You can cause any weapon you carry to appear as anything else of approximately similar size and material. If you have no &lt;strong&gt;BDE&lt;/strong&gt; you can expend one anyway, at the cost of taking whatever damage is rolled on it even if it doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;explode&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; You can imbue area-of-effect spells into objects, which are triggered when they are impacted with force. These have a &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; chance upon use of being duds and instead becoming a piece of &lt;strong&gt;potential violence&lt;/strong&gt; that releases the imbued spell when it detonates.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;explosive&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt; damage from your &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; template (and attack-generated pieces of &lt;strong&gt;potential violence&lt;/strong&gt;) is doubled, to &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt;. At will, you can detonate all pieces of &lt;strong&gt;potential violence&lt;/strong&gt; within your line of sight, regardless of whether you are aware of them or not.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-3rd-goblins-of-civilized-lands.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;prompt today&lt;strong&gt;two days ago&lt;/strong&gt; is&lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;lsquo;Goblins&amp;rsquo;. Lets knock that one out before I continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-civilized-lands&#34;&gt;The Civilized Lands &lt;a href=&#34;#the-civilized-lands&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Civilized Lands, from whence adventurers come to &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html&#34;&gt;the Mountain,&lt;/a&gt; are dominated by two large culture-groups, each formed from several component polities. They are the &lt;strong&gt;River Kingdoms,&lt;/strong&gt; an imperial federation that originated in the homelands of the orcs, and the &lt;strong&gt;Charter Nations&lt;/strong&gt;, a more loosely organized alliance and trade group that originated in the homelands of the goblinoids. Today, we are concerned with the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-puAuQ9gaGTY/X3oc3GISMJI/AAAAAAAAqGY/BMtZVU9Z_w0k9IaIkRLnIw7edAVjHz2NQCLcBGAsYHQ/s488/TypicalGoblin.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-puAuQ9gaGTY/X3oc3GISMJI/AAAAAAAAqGY/BMtZVU9Z_w0k9IaIkRLnIw7edAVjHz2NQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/TypicalGoblin.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A goblin peasant levy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;goblinoids&#34;&gt;Goblinoids &lt;a href=&#34;#goblinoids&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt; has this to say about goblinoids:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Goblinoid:  Bright red or yellow eyes with slit pupils, catlike noses, small pointed teeth, bushy sideburns (across all three sexes), and dull orange, yellow, or green skin covered with fine, short, downy fur. Goblinoid society holds that the place of men and women is at home, so most (but not all) goblinoid adventurers are neuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Bugbear:  Eight to nine feet tall (-1 AC, can wield heavy weapons as if they were medium), +1 STR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. Hobgoblin:  Skin and fur tend towards warmer colors, five to six feet tall, +1 DEX.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Goblin:  About three feet tall (+1 AC, can only wield medium weapons two-handed and can’t wield heavy weapons), +1 DEX&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, I was an E6 3.5e gal first, so that&amp;rsquo;s what my goblinoids look like. Fine, downy fur, big sideburns, and little wet cat noses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They&amp;rsquo;re born in litters, about ten at a time, usually one or two of each binary sex and the rest neuter. Bugbears are a genetic anomaly which are born among litters of any other sort of goblinoid, and appear normal as infants but grow to their full size rapidly. Goblinoid natural philosophers theorize that these traits existed to enable their survival of some great hardship in their shared prehistory, and Charter Nation societies tend to have fairly strict gender roles as a result; expecting goblinoid men and women to be parents and homemakers while more physically hazardous roles such as mining, millwork, and military service are filled by neuters. As a result of this, of course, more adventurously-minded male and female goblinoids are likely to be encountered in regions outside of the Charter Nations themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AzvIOr5sLGw/X3oj9YDGljI/AAAAAAAAqGk/iDuNBLoQUgANO0sl2SiIgesOV-FuSLFtQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1813/tumblr_p9i57clU0T1ud46s0o1_1280.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AzvIOr5sLGw/X3oj9YDGljI/AAAAAAAAqGk/iDuNBLoQUgANO0sl2SiIgesOV-FuSLFtQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tumblr_p9i57clU0T1ud46s0o1_1280.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hobgoblin &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html&#34;&gt;FIGHTMASTER,&lt;/a&gt; or perhaps a BATTLEMAGE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-charter-nations&#34;&gt;The Charter Nations &lt;a href=&#34;#the-charter-nations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are six on the Charter Court, with innumerable petty nations, city-states, and feudal holdings between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Durras&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest, tundra, and steppe; geographically massive, sparsely populated, and rich in natural resources. A feudal empire, stagnant in neither ascent nor decline. Durrans are reputed as cold to those they don&amp;rsquo;t know and generous and loyal to those they trust. Majority goblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Escautia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rolling hills and inclement weather; spread between the continental coast and a few small islands. A kingdom, technically, or between one and three depending on who you ask. Escautians are reputed as superstitious, worldly, and crude in manner. Majority hobgoblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eturica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharp mountain ridges, open plains, plenty of coastline. An ancient and rich empire in decline. Eturicans are reputed as greedy, debauched, and detail-oriented. Majority hobgoblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kolvenia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An archipelago of rocky cliffs and plateaus; warm year-round except at high altitudes. A federated commonwealth of city-states. Kolvenians are reputed as prone to vice, sloth, science, and romance. Majority goblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ostmarch-Montague&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forest, field, and river; large but land-locked. Two kingdoms merged into one through marriage, an uneasy union. Ostmarchers and Montaguans are reputed as excellent brewers, gourmands, and stubborn perfectionists. Majority goblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pyrenica&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flat plains ascending to rugged hills; sunny and warm. An ascendant empire, struggling with the tensions of industrialization. Pyrenicans are reputed as arrogant, prideful, and musically and culinarily talented. Majority hobgoblin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It should go without saying that most of these &amp;lsquo;reputations&amp;rsquo; originate outside of the nations mentioned and very possibly none are true. Goblinoids are a diverse bunch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Let There Be Blood and also HELLBASTARDS</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-let-there-be-blood-and-also.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2020 01:15:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-let-there-be-blood-and-also.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XoeCGaRJTPc/X3Yn2M50D5I/AAAAAAAAqGM/Pi6vXFN3lCQ8A2_MHcQl_gk84UZBHSPhQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/blood.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-XoeCGaRJTPc/X3Yn2M50D5I/AAAAAAAAqGM/Pi6vXFN3lCQ8A2_MHcQl_gk84UZBHSPhQCLcBGAsYHQ/w320-h240/blood.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;prompt today is &amp;lsquo;Blood&amp;rsquo;. Blood is &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-on-fire-elements-and-old-gods.html&#34;&gt;one of the four elements.&lt;/a&gt; But normally there&amp;rsquo;s only one kind of blood. That&amp;rsquo;s kind of boring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;here-are-some-more-types-of-blood-you-can-have&#34;&gt;Here are some more types of blood you can have. &lt;a href=&#34;#here-are-some-more-types-of-blood-you-can-have&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Royal blood.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s blue. &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html&#34;&gt;Satans&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elf&#34;&gt;vampires&lt;/a&gt; prize it especially, for some reason.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;rsquo;s flammable. &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-c-is-for-cave-beasts-companions.html&#34;&gt;Horses have oil for blood,&lt;/a&gt; why don&amp;rsquo;t you? This one seems dangerous.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spiders!&lt;/strong&gt; Thousands of &amp;rsquo;em. Are they your children? Are you a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/05/no-light-no-warmth-giant-spider-ii.html&#34;&gt;spider in disguise?&lt;/a&gt; Nobody will ever know, unless you tell &amp;rsquo;em.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too much blood.&lt;/strong&gt; We&amp;rsquo;re talking quentin tarantino horror movie splatters every time you get cut, and a complete inability to suffer from (or die due to) blood loss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Music.&lt;/strong&gt; Since &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;songs are swords,&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://wmbsaltworks.wordpress.com/2020/06/03/glog-class-swordsinger/&#34;&gt;vice versa,&lt;/a&gt; this can be at least a little unfortunate from time to time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal-ass blood.&lt;/strong&gt; Sometimes you just gotta chill out for a second. It can&amp;rsquo;t be all weird blood all the time, or none of the weird blood is weird anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communism.&lt;/strong&gt; Blood is red, at least normally. You know what else is&amp;hellip; Red? That&amp;rsquo;s right. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what this does but if you or someone around you can &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html&#34;&gt;talk to blood&lt;/a&gt; you should probably ask it how to solve &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformation_problem&#34;&gt;the transformation problem.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragon blood.&lt;/strong&gt; Does it make you greedy? &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-d-is-for-dragons.html&#34;&gt;Paranoid?&lt;/a&gt; No, that&amp;rsquo;s fascist race science, your blood doesn&amp;rsquo;t define you. Having dragon blood does mean you count as a dragon (and not as a normal, non-dragon person) for things that care about that, though. Dragons probably make a lot of things that care about that, because they&amp;rsquo;re fascists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;9-ferrofluid-and-ink-digression-hellbastards&#34;&gt;9. Ferrofluid and ink. DIGRESSION: HELLBASTARDS  &lt;a href=&#34;#9-ferrofluid-and-ink-digression-hellbastards&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;when you are a hellbastard part of your body (a hand, or both hands, or your tongue, or your heart and all your blood, or your eyeballs and brain) is inky black and wet-looking, as if you had spilled ink on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;everyone HATES hellbastards. that&amp;rsquo;s why they&amp;rsquo;re called hellbastards. so you better fuckin&amp;rsquo; keep that shit covered up. they&amp;rsquo;ll like, run you out of town or stone you to death. regular people roll &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you&amp;rsquo;re visibly a hellbastard around them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blacktongue:&lt;/strong&gt; tongue is inky black and far too long, might also be forked. blacktongue hellbastards are fond of masks, fans, scarves, and whispering sweet words from behind their hands. if you&amp;rsquo;re a blacktongue hellbastard you count your &lt;strong&gt;Charisma&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;2 higher&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you&amp;rsquo;re in darkness, and &lt;strong&gt;2 lower&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you&amp;rsquo;re in bright light. once per day, or as many times as you want during the night, you can &lt;strong&gt;extinguish a light within 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; by flicking your tongue at it and swallowing it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blackheart:&lt;/strong&gt; veins show dark beneath the skin and black in the corners of the eyes. blood is incredibly pigmented, so opaque it can be used as ink or dye, and ferrous &amp;ndash; reacts to magnetic fields like ferrofluid or the weird stuff megan fox pukes up in jennifer&amp;rsquo;s body. it dries into salty magnetic tar. the blood flows slowly and hurts constantly with the dull full-body ache of a hangover. blackheart hellbastards move like rickety old people and often affect canes or crutches for comfort, though they can move swiftly when they need to. direct sunlight causes your veins to smoke through your skin and any open wounds to sputter and crackle, dealing &lt;strong&gt;1 damage per minute&lt;/strong&gt; of continual exposure &amp;ndash; this can be avoided with voluminous clothing or by being careful to stay on the shady side of the street, etc etc. you get &lt;strong&gt;+1 Strength&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;-1 Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; and roll on the &lt;strong&gt;Death &amp;amp; Dismemberment&lt;/strong&gt; table with advantage whenever you&amp;rsquo;re a blackheart hellbastard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blackhand:&lt;/strong&gt; entire hand or hands are blackened, up to the wrists and partway up the forearms. &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-blackhand-warrior.html&#34;&gt;i think this one is a whole-ass class and it&amp;rsquo;s the guy from princess mononoke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;blackmind:&lt;/strong&gt; turn all your &lt;strong&gt;spells&lt;/strong&gt; into blackened hellbastards. &lt;strong&gt;immune&lt;/strong&gt; to most mind-affecting stuff, can&amp;rsquo;t be a &lt;strong&gt;paladin.&lt;/strong&gt; If anyone ever cuts open your head your brain drips out like &lt;strong&gt;motor oil.&lt;/strong&gt; your eyes are completely black and this is even more disconcerting and scary than any other kind of hellbastard and everyone gets an extra &lt;strong&gt;2 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on morale checks if you personally cause them. you can see in complete darkness as if it were bright light, and if its magical absolute darkness then it also lets you see invisible things and lies and hidden danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. &lt;strong&gt;Honey.&lt;/strong&gt; This marks you either as one of the &lt;strong&gt;fey&lt;/strong&gt; or a very carefully constructed simulacrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. &lt;strong&gt;Extremely potent psychedelic-dissociative-deliriants.&lt;/strong&gt; Don&amp;rsquo;t lick your wounds. Or do, I guess. I&amp;rsquo;m not your mom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. &lt;strong&gt;Text.&lt;/strong&gt; pages and pages and pages and pages and pages and pages and pages and pages. secrets, mysteries, books that haven&amp;rsquo;t been written yet and ones that have been written many, many times. all written in monospaced pixelated font, like an old computer terminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. &lt;strong&gt;Type O negative.&lt;/strong&gt; This makes you a universal donor. That&amp;rsquo;s a valuable thing to be. Sucks for you if you &lt;em&gt;need&lt;/em&gt; blood, though. Some people will tell you this makes you more likely to be outgoing, have leadership abilities, easily shrug off small issues and details, be frequently late (and rude), resilient, and flexible. I think they&amp;rsquo;re probably right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. &lt;strong&gt;Thread.&lt;/strong&gt; A single, unbroken, string of red. As strong as reasonably strong fishing line. There must be miles of this stuff in you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. &lt;strong&gt;Poison.&lt;/strong&gt; On the upside, this means you&amp;rsquo;re probably immune to poison, or else you would have died by now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. &lt;strong&gt;Seawater.&lt;/strong&gt; Foaming brine. Contains all the things the actual ocean does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17. &lt;strong&gt;Glittering black glass.&lt;/strong&gt; Molten in your veins, so probably you never get cold. Quickly hardens into brittle curls and cruel twisting spires when exposed to the air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18. &lt;strong&gt;Clay.&lt;/strong&gt; Wet, slowly trickling. This makes you extremely hard to move if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be moved, for mysterious reasons that have absolutely nothing to do with real-world physics. It also means you can&amp;rsquo;t bleed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19. &lt;strong&gt;Blue house paint.&lt;/strong&gt; Why do you have this? Is this part of some elaborate con to fake a claim to the throne? Probably, I mean that&amp;rsquo;s pretty much the only reason I can think of to replace your blood with blue paint. You definitely weren&amp;rsquo;t born like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20. &lt;strong&gt;BATTLEFIRE.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html&#34;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;okay-yeah-thats-great-vayra-but-what-the-fuck-do-i-do-with-it&#34;&gt;okay yeah that&amp;rsquo;s great Vayra but what the fuck do i DO with it &lt;a href=&#34;#okay-yeah-thats-great-vayra-but-what-the-fuck-do-i-do-with-it&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apply this to every character from now on.

      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-modern-fiddly-firearms.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2020 00:07:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/10/glogtober-modern-fiddly-firearms.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt; &lt;em&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/random-generators-for-apocalypse-and.html&#34;&gt;second-ever blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I said &amp;ldquo;i also wrote a gigantic table of firearm damage by specific real-world caliber, which is fun if your gaming group has gun nerds in it. maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll post that later&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a refined, somewhat &lt;strong&gt;simplified&lt;/strong&gt; (yes) version of that, hopefully suitable for use in games that are not mine and are run by people who have a (very slightly) lower tolerance for ~firearm verisimilitude~. I__t&amp;rsquo;s all the sort of complicated that you figure out when you pick up a gun, not every time you fire it, so it runs fairly smoothly in play if you&amp;rsquo;re not swapping stuff around all the time&amp;hellip; Still rather complicated, though.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damage has been reduced a little from my original system (which was designed for d20 E6 with d8 HD) to be more appropriate for GLOG, but is still very lethal. Try not to get shot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy &lt;a href=&#34;https://sunderedshillings.blogspot.com/2020/09/glogtober.html&#34;&gt;GLOGtober&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MeekShockingCaecilian-size_restricted.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://thumbs.gfycat.com/MeekShockingCaecilian-size_restricted.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;armor&#34;&gt;Armor &lt;a href=&#34;#armor&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This whole thing works better if you have armor give HP instead of AC. This lets you have dramatic moments where you get knocked on your ass when someone shoots you in the chest with a rifle, only to pull off your shattered plate carrier and return fire. You can still get AC from Dex, maybe Wis, and cover. My recommendation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light&lt;/strong&gt; armor: A flak jacket, an undercover vest, other soft body armor, etc. Doesn&amp;rsquo;t get in the way. &lt;strong&gt;5-10 HP.&lt;/strong&gt; An unarmored vehicle counts as having this level of protection.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Medium&lt;/strong&gt; armor. A plate carrier with ballistic panels rated for intermediate cartridges. Quite heavy, encumbers like &lt;strong&gt;chain&lt;/strong&gt; in your favorite medieval/early-modern RPG. &lt;strong&gt;15 HP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy&lt;/strong&gt; armor. Hard body armor with NIJ Level IV protection, likely covering the shoulders, sides, and upper legs. Heavy and restrictive, encumbers like &lt;strong&gt;plate&lt;/strong&gt; in a medieval/early-modern RPG. &lt;strong&gt;20 HP.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s also vehicle armor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; armor. On an APC, combat helicopter, or equivalent. You can&amp;rsquo;t wear this, unless it&amp;rsquo;s on an exoskeleton or something.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; armor. Actual tank plating. You can&amp;rsquo;t wear this, ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal armor&lt;/strong&gt; is damaged before your HP, except by critical hits, weapons that say they penetrate its level of protection or better, and stuff that would ignore armor logically (falling damage, etc).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vehicle armor&lt;/strong&gt; is the vehicle&amp;rsquo;s entire HP, and can &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; be damaged by weapons that say they penetrate its level of protection or better, or critical hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More advanced, rarer materials might provide higher HP values or protect at higher levels. Improvised ones might provide less HP or encumber at higher levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cartridges&#34;&gt;Cartridges &lt;a href=&#34;#cartridges&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most important part of the firearm isn&amp;rsquo;t actually the firearm, it&amp;rsquo;s, uh, what it fires. This is what damage is based on. Cartridge stats have three values: &lt;strong&gt;Damage, Recoil,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Armor Penetration.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ll explain recoil when we talk about firearms themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also &lt;strong&gt;noise&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;range&lt;/strong&gt;, I guess. Something with the &amp;ldquo;quiet&amp;rdquo; tag will be hard to notice from far away or pinpoint the direction of, especially if suppressed. Something with the &amp;ldquo;loud&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;very loud&amp;rdquo; tag probably can&amp;rsquo;t be suppressed effectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Range&lt;/strong&gt; is dependent on class, potentially modified if you have a really long barrel or whatever. We&amp;rsquo;ll get to that later. For now all you need to know is that you get &lt;strong&gt;-1 to hit&lt;/strong&gt; for each range increment beyond the first: &lt;strong&gt;i.e.&lt;/strong&gt; a .22LR pistol gets -0 to hit within 30&amp;rsquo;, -1 to hit within 60&amp;rsquo;, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of some cold-war-era-to-modern stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Pistol - Range 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Pistol (.22 LR, .25, .32 or .380 ACP) - &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R0&lt;/strong&gt; - quiet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Pistol (9mm, .38 or .44 Special, .45 ACP, .40S&amp;amp;W) - &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R1&lt;/strong&gt; - quiet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Heavy Pistol - Range 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AP Pistol (HK 4.6mm, FN 5.7mm, 5.8mm DAP92, 7.62 Tokarev, sci-fi pistol) - &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R2&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnum Pistol (.357 or .44 Magnum, 10mm Auto, .50AE) - &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R3&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Light&lt;/strong&gt; - loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fuckoff Pistol (.454 Casull, sci-fi bullshit) - &lt;strong&gt;3d6&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R5&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Medium&lt;/strong&gt; - very loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intermediate Rifle - Range 60&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsonic Rifle (9x39mm, .300 AAC) - &lt;strong&gt;1d10&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R2&lt;/strong&gt; - quiet&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Intermediate Rifle (5.56 NATO/.223 Rem., 5.45 and 7.62x39mm, 5.8x42mm) - &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R2&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;High Power Intermediate (6.5mm Creedmoor, .50 Beowulf, sci-fi intermediate) - &lt;strong&gt;2d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R3&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Light&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-Power Rifle - Range 90&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full-Power Rifle (7.62 NATO/.308 Win., .303 British, 7.62x54R, .30-06) - &lt;strong&gt;3d6&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R4&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Medium&lt;/strong&gt; - loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnum Rifle (7mm Rem Mag, .338 Lap Mag, .300 Norma Mag, sci-fi rifle) - &lt;strong&gt;3d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R5&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Heavy&lt;/strong&gt; - loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Materiel Rifle (.408 CheyTac, .50 BMG, 12.7x108mm) - &lt;strong&gt;4d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R7&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Light Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; - very loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Autocannon (14.5x114mm, 20mm, sci-fi AMR) - &lt;strong&gt;6d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;AP Light Vehicle&lt;/strong&gt; - very loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Shotgun - Range 30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light Shotgun (20 gauge) - &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Standard Shotgun (12 gauge) - &lt;strong&gt;3d8&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;R4&lt;/strong&gt; - loud&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;firearms&#34;&gt;Firearms &lt;a href=&#34;#firearms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The important parts of a firearm are its **Size, Ammo, **&lt;strong&gt;Action/Fire Modes,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Recoil.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Size **is pretty obvious. Can you fire it effectively with one hand or not. How many slots does it take up in your inventory. That sort of thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ammo&lt;/strong&gt; is how many rounds it can hold. &lt;strong&gt;Reloading&lt;/strong&gt; takes a &lt;strong&gt;move action&lt;/strong&gt; (i.e. can be done in place of your movement &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; your action for the turn) **per round, clip, or magazine loaded. **If you&amp;rsquo;re a &lt;strong&gt;Fighter&lt;/strong&gt; maybe you can move and reload at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Actions&lt;/strong&gt;determine what &lt;strong&gt;fire modes&lt;/strong&gt; are available with a firearm and if it can be used for iterative attacks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single-shot&lt;/strong&gt; firearms have to be reloaded between each attack. Break-action shotguns and rifles are probably the most common form of this, but there are some single-shot bolt-action rifles as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manual (pump, lever, bolt, single, etc)-action&lt;/strong&gt; firearms have to be manually cycled between each attack. It&amp;rsquo;s assumed that you&amp;rsquo;re doing this automatically as long as you have a free hand, but it means you can only make one attack with them per round even if you have multiple attacks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Semi-automatic&lt;/strong&gt; firearms fire one shot with each pull of the trigger. You can use them to make as many attacks as you have in a round. If you&amp;rsquo;re a &lt;strong&gt;Fighter,&lt;/strong&gt; maybe you can also &lt;strong&gt;double tap&lt;/strong&gt; to fire a 2-round &lt;strong&gt;burst&lt;/strong&gt; with one.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fully automatic&lt;/strong&gt; firearms fire continually while the trigger is held. You can probably only fire &lt;strong&gt;bursts&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;full-auto&lt;/strong&gt; with them. If you&amp;rsquo;re a &lt;strong&gt;Fighter,&lt;/strong&gt; maybe you can also use them to fire single shots.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Select-fire&lt;/strong&gt; firearms can be used as if they were either &lt;strong&gt;semi-&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;fully automatic.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Modes&lt;/strong&gt; modify &lt;strong&gt;recoil, damage,&lt;/strong&gt; and potentially &lt;strong&gt;area of effect&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Single&lt;/strong&gt; shots cost &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; ammo and don&amp;rsquo;t modify recoil or damage at all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burst&lt;/strong&gt; fire costs &lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; ammo, &lt;strong&gt;doubles&lt;/strong&gt; recoil, and adds &lt;strong&gt;1 die&lt;/strong&gt; of damage. A &lt;strong&gt;double-barreled&lt;/strong&gt; firearm counts as firing a &lt;strong&gt;burst&lt;/strong&gt; if you fire both barrels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full-auto&lt;/strong&gt; fire costs &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; ammo, &lt;strong&gt;trebles&lt;/strong&gt; recoil, and either adds &lt;strong&gt;2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;dice&lt;/strong&gt; of damage &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; hits everyone in a cone (roll the attack roll once, compare to all ACs or have them roll Dex vs your attack or whatever).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recoil&lt;/strong&gt; starts with the recoil value of the cartridge, then is lowered by the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignore recoil&lt;/strong&gt; if fired from a fixed mount on a vehicle or fortification or whatever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-4 recoil&lt;/strong&gt; if set up on a bipod or fired from a prone position, etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2 recoil&lt;/strong&gt; if the barrel is real long and/or heavy, like on a machine gun or full-length sniper or hunting rifle. This also doubles your &lt;strong&gt;range.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-2 recoil&lt;/strong&gt; if it has a stock and you&amp;rsquo;re using it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1 recoil&lt;/strong&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re holding it in two hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-1 recoil&lt;/strong&gt; per point of &lt;strong&gt;STR&lt;/strong&gt; bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s got gyroscopic stabilization or a huge muzzle brake or something? You can figure out anything special beyond that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All of these apply &lt;strong&gt;after&lt;/strong&gt; multiplying recoil for burst or full-auto fire. Whatever&amp;rsquo;s left is a penalty to your attack roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;thats-fiddly-as-hell-fuck-you-vayra&#34;&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s fiddly as hell, fuck you Vayra &lt;a href=&#34;#thats-fiddly-as-hell-fuck-you-vayra&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yeah, it is, but you and your players only have to calculate this stuff once per gun. I recommend doing it in advance and building a table or generator or something. For example, here are some guns:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beretta 92FS.&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-auto, 9x19mm Parabellum (1d8, R1/2, 30&amp;rsquo;), 15 round magazine, 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Colt Python.&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-auto, .357 Magnum (2d6, R3/6, 30&amp;rsquo;), 6 round cylinder, 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remington 1900 Sawn-Off.&lt;/strong&gt; Break-action, 12 gauge (3d8, R1/5 in two hands or 4/8 in one, 30&amp;rsquo;), double-barreled, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PPSh-41.&lt;/strong&gt; Full-auto, 7.62x25mm Tokarev (1d8, R0/1/3, AP Light, 30&amp;rsquo;), 35 round magazine or 71 round drum, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;M4 Carbine.&lt;/strong&gt; Select-fire, 5.56x45mm NATO (2d6, R0/1/3, AP Light, 60&amp;rsquo;), 30 round magazine, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Remington 700.&lt;/strong&gt; Bolt-action, .308 Winchester (3d6, R0, AP Medium, 180&amp;rsquo;), 5 round internal magazine (clip-loaded), 2 slots.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dragunov SVD.&lt;/strong&gt; Semi-auto, 7.62x54mmR (3d6, R0/3, AP Medium, 180&amp;rsquo;), 10 round magazine, 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FN FAL 50.63 PARA.&lt;/strong&gt; Select-fire, 7.62x51mm NATO (3d6, R1/5/9, AP Medium, 90&amp;rsquo;), 20 round magazine, 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sako TRG-42.&lt;/strong&gt; Bolt-action, .338 Lapua Magnum (3d8, R0, AP Heavy, 180&amp;rsquo;), 5 round magazine, 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mossberg 500.&lt;/strong&gt; Pump-action, 12 gauge (3d8, R0, 30&amp;rsquo;), 5 round tube, 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recoil values include stocks and stuff but don&amp;rsquo;t assume two hands on a pistol, and are given for single/burst/auto where applicable. Slap that on a table somewhere for reference, and now you have it forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone picks up a gun, they write the name down in their inventory and figure out their attack bonus with it and they&amp;rsquo;re good to go. Here&amp;rsquo;s how I&amp;rsquo;d write attacks with some of these down on my sheet for a &lt;strong&gt;2nd-level&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Fighter&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;+1 STR&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;+0 DEX:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9mm Beretta 92FS,&lt;/strong&gt; +2 ranged (-1 per 30&amp;rsquo;), 1d8 or double-tap (-1 if one-handed) for 2d8 and 2 ammo. 16/15 loaded, 15/15, 8/15 in spares, 83 loose rounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.62x25mm PPSh-41,&lt;/strong&gt; +2 ranged (-1 per 30&amp;rsquo;), 1d8 AP Light, 56/71 rounds loaded&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            **Burst **+2 ranged (-1 per 30&amp;rsquo;), 2d8 AP Light, 3 ammo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;Full-auto&lt;/strong&gt; +0 ranged  (-1 per 30&amp;rsquo;), 3d8 AP Light &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; cone at single damage, 5 ammo &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.62x51mm FAL PARA,&lt;/strong&gt; +2 ranged (-1 per 90&amp;rsquo;), 3d6 AP Medium, 20/20 loaded, 10/20 in spares&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;Double-tap&lt;/strong&gt; -2 ranged (-1 per 90&amp;rsquo;), 4d6 AP Medium, 2 ammo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;            &lt;strong&gt;Full-auto&lt;/strong&gt; -6 ranged (-1 per 90&amp;rsquo;), 5d6 AP Medium &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; cone at single damage, 5 ammo, note to self: don&amp;rsquo;t do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-guy-made-this-in-his-garage-while-on-pcp-and-tried-to-rob-a-train-with-it-and-got-shot-and-then-i-found-it-in-the-sand-twenty-years-later-is-it-still-safe-to-shoot&#34;&gt;A guy made this in his garage while on PCP and tried to rob a train with it and got shot and then I found it in the sand twenty years later, is it still safe to shoot? &lt;a href=&#34;#a-guy-made-this-in-his-garage-while-on-pcp-and-tried-to-rob-a-train-with-it-and-got-shot-and-then-i-found-it-in-the-sand-twenty-years-later-is-it-still-safe-to-shoot&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Professionally made firearms that are frequently maintained have no chance of catastrophic failure. If you fumble your attack roll with one it &lt;strong&gt;jams&lt;/strong&gt; and will have to be &lt;strong&gt;reloaded.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For everyone else, here&amp;rsquo;s my post-apocalyptic quality table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professionally made&lt;/strong&gt; firearms fumble on &lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; Roll a &lt;strong&gt;d20:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 breaks; 2-20 jams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decent quality&lt;/strong&gt; firearms fumble on &lt;strong&gt;1-2.&lt;/strong&gt; Roll a &lt;strong&gt;d20:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 explodes; 2-10 breaks; 11-20 jams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jury-rigged&lt;/strong&gt; firearms fumble on &lt;strong&gt;1-3.&lt;/strong&gt; Roll a &lt;strong&gt;d20:&lt;/strong&gt; 1-5 explodes; 6-10 breaks; 11-20 jams.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploding&lt;/strong&gt; firearms deal their regular single-shot damage to their wielder, with a &lt;strong&gt;DEX&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half. &lt;strong&gt;Broken&lt;/strong&gt; firearms can be repaired with gun parts and either an &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; roll or a skilled armorer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-about-melee-weapons&#34;&gt;What about melee weapons? &lt;a href=&#34;#what-about-melee-weapons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;They should do more damage too, damnit.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NO LIGHT NO WARMTH: Illuminated Paladin (Class: Specialist)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/09/no-light-no-warmth-illuminated-paladin.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 23 Sep 2020 17:02:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/09/no-light-no-warmth-illuminated-paladin.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somewhere towards the &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-unfinished-world-glog-campaign.html&#34;&gt;southern edge of the tetrahedral world&lt;/a&gt;, an expedition gathers&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_This is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s edge-climb campaign thingy, not &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;GROG&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have stolen every word within this post from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;Metatron&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html&#34;&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-gun-priest.html&#34;&gt;Gun Priest&lt;/a&gt;, and/or my own &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/no-light-no-warmth-oiled-paladin-class.html&#34;&gt;Oiled Paladin&lt;/a&gt;. _&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_It seems the difference between a Paladin and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html&#34;&gt;Cleric&lt;/a&gt; is that a Paladin can&amp;rsquo;t talk to angels directly and instead draws (sometimes) more practical powers from them in exchange for those powers being (usually) more consistently available and lesser consequences from breaking their tenets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not completely happy with this but I have determined to Just Post and fix it later, if it is determined to require fixing. Death to drafts!_&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;_class-illuminated-paladin-purple-heretic_&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Class: Illuminated Paladin (Purple Heretic)&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#_class-illuminated-paladin-purple-heretic_&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3WTGjrfvcgQ/X2aAMs3KVwI/AAAAAAAAqBY/NaHecIikBU4c678hnUoiqo6l2YcMAgeJgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1047/purplemasks.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3WTGjrfvcgQ/X2aAMs3KVwI/AAAAAAAAqBY/NaHecIikBU4c678hnUoiqo6l2YcMAgeJgCLcBGAsYHQ/w400-h141/purplemasks.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Purple Heretics are a gnostic group. They believe their texts contain esoterica never revealed to the masses. In them, alcohol is prohibited and harems recommended. The g_ds&amp;rsquo; disappearance is a puzzle to be solved, and those who do so will no doubt be among the elect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a follower of the Purple &lt;em&gt;Orthodoxy&lt;/em&gt; and you&amp;rsquo;re &lt;em&gt;damned proud of it.&lt;/em&gt; You have come here in search of secrets, that you might know the truth of the world. You tattoo your skin and wear your mask proudly, for it marks you as one who is—above all else—&lt;strong&gt;possessed of knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-play-cleric.html&#34;&gt;This is how you should play every character with a link to the divine, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; how you should play an illuminated paladin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tenets of the Purple Orthodoxy, in order of importance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not, through action or inaction, allow error to be taught.&lt;/strong&gt; Use fire if necessary. Ignore all other tenets if they would interfere with this, your most important goal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not share information with the unworthy or those who would misuse it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seek out ancient tomes and ruins; do not allow information to be lost or forgotten.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Correct those who are under false impressions, unless this would interfere with the second tenet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accumulate libraries and stores of secret information, unless this would break the third tenet.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take off your mask or break a tenet, you can&amp;rsquo;t use any Illuminated Paladin class features except &lt;strong&gt;fieldwork&lt;/strong&gt; and **extra attack per round **until you put your mask back on &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; do at least three of: Edit a text, learn something new and important, point out to someone how they&amp;rsquo;re wrong, eat a solid meal, stay awake for an entire night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template of this class you have, you gain **+1 SKLL. **You use the &lt;strong&gt;specialist&lt;/strong&gt; to-hit progression, increasing by &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; at templates &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt; If you have at least one template in this class you can never fumble while using &lt;strong&gt;fencing weapons&lt;/strong&gt; or **firearms. **You &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t wear armor&lt;/strong&gt; unless you have training or templates in another class that lets you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Starting Equipment: **A purple mask (see image), academic robes, burglar&amp;rsquo;s clothing, soft leather boots and gloves, a parrying dagger (&lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt;), tattoo kit, writing supplies, a regular holy book (from the Church), an irregular holy book (from your mentor), a very irregular holy book (which you are writing), and one other &lt;strong&gt;academic implement&lt;/strong&gt; chosen from the list at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; Papermaking, Bookbinding, Calligraphy, and Illumination &lt;strong&gt;plus&lt;/strong&gt; one of: 1. History, 2. Historiography, 3. Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Fieldwork, Illuminated (1 Truth)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Erudition, Pointed Criticism, +1 Truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C:&lt;/strong&gt; Confession, Extra Attack Per Round, +1 Truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Hypotheses, Thought Library, +1 Truth&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Fieldwork&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve trained for this. You have a **3-in-6 **chance of picking a common lock (&lt;strong&gt;2-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; for something more secure, &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; for a safe or the like) and a **1-in-6 chance **to understand any specific bit of language you don&amp;rsquo;t know—like a page in a book, inscription on a ring, occult chanted phrase, or passage gleaned through &lt;strong&gt;Erudition&lt;/strong&gt;—that you encounter. Both of these chances improve by &lt;strong&gt;1-in-6&lt;/strong&gt; for each additional template of this class beyond &lt;strong&gt;A.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Illuminated&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template of this class you have, one-quarter of your body&amp;rsquo;s external surface area is covered in illuminated tattoos depicting one of the most important Truths you know. Roll on the Truth table for specifics at each template. If you roll a duplicate, choose the next non-duplicate Truth above or below it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If one of your Truths is ever proven false, you lose the benefit of that Truth until you can have the tattoo corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Erudition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first time you touch any given text, you immediately know the most important &lt;strong&gt;107 sequential words&lt;/strong&gt; contained therein. You can read a text of any length in one hour as long as you have a quiet place to sit and no interruptions, and identify places where a text has been edited or redacted at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Pointed Criticism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You study your enemies carefully, and are adept at using this knowledge to throw them off balance and erode their will to fight. For each &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;horrible secret&lt;/strong&gt; of a target that you correctly declare to them before making your first attack, you have &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; to hit them and they have &lt;strong&gt;-1&lt;/strong&gt; to hit you  and on &lt;strong&gt;Morale&lt;/strong&gt; checks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Names&lt;/strong&gt; are any names that the target has been known by—like full name, pseudonyms, and epithets; not first, middle, and last. &lt;strong&gt;Horrible secrets&lt;/strong&gt; are anything that they would rather you not know—like shameful habits, past failures, and uncomfortable associations, each of which must be distinct from any others mentioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This ability applies to debates and arguments as well as physical combat, but only works against targets that are capable of understanding you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Confession&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every ten minutes that you engage someone in spirited discussion, debate, or argument, you can ask them one question which they must answer and answer truthfully. Roll &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;INT,&lt;/strong&gt; whichever is more advantageous for you—if you succeed, they don&amp;rsquo;t realize that you asked the question, or that they answered it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given ten minutes of meditation, you can commune with &lt;strong&gt;angels&lt;/strong&gt; to pronounce a &lt;strong&gt;hypothesis.&lt;/strong&gt; The GM will tell you whether your &lt;strong&gt;hypothesis&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;strong&gt;true, partially true, or false.&lt;/strong&gt; If it is &lt;strong&gt;false,&lt;/strong&gt; you first take damage equal to your current &lt;strong&gt;Falsehoods&lt;/strong&gt;, then increase your **Falsehoods **by &lt;strong&gt;107.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;strong&gt;Falsehoods&lt;/strong&gt; decreases by &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; for each point of damage you take from any source, and each time you read or burn a text you had not already read or burn&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Thought Library&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you interact with texts owned or possessed by someone else, any changes you make—placing, removing, editing, et cetera—are reflected in their actual memory. Doing so has similar effects to one of the two &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;Signature Techniques&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;Company&lt;/strong&gt; as performed with &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;2 Memory Dice.&lt;/strong&gt; Which &lt;strong&gt;Signature Technique&lt;/strong&gt; and how many &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; you roll depend on what exactly you are doing.If rolled with 2, you suffer any &lt;strong&gt;Mistakes&lt;/strong&gt; as an actual Metatron would.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;truths&#34;&gt;Truths &lt;a href=&#34;#truths&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When you gain a Truth, write down what you think&lt;strong&gt;are completely sure&lt;/strong&gt; it is. You have to be careful about your Truths, particularly once you have access to &lt;strong&gt;Hypotheses&lt;/strong&gt; or if you have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html&#34;&gt;Sage&lt;/a&gt; or 4-template &lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-gun-priest.html&#34;&gt;Gun Priest&lt;/a&gt; around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These (or at least their names) will need to be replaced for other campaigns. They should be major questions about the setting that are understood well enough to be asked but not answered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The existence of the Soul.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your tattooed skin can interact with ghosts, spells, angels, et cetera as if they existed physically, and your melee attacks deal full damage to undead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fates of the G_ds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have &lt;strong&gt;+1 AC&lt;/strong&gt; per template, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t stack with normal armor. When someone you knew the name of dies, their name appears on your right arm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The identity of the Fifth Brother.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your mask is unrecognizable to those you would prefer not to know you, and your tattoos are invisible to those you would prefer not to see them and illegible to those you would prefer not to understand them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The origin of Man.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While performing hard labor you need no food, water, nor sleep. Once finished a work, you must &amp;lsquo;catch up&amp;rsquo; on all the food, water, and sleep you missed before working beyond normal human limits again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The source of Monkey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With a word, you can cause everything in contact with your tattoos to fuse to them, holding them—or you—in place. It&amp;rsquo;s probably an &lt;strong&gt;INIT&lt;/strong&gt; roll to use this to stop yourself from falling or something. Obviously you also need to have bare, tattooed skin in contact with the things you want to stick to. Don&amp;rsquo;t do this when you already have a lot of momentum unless you want your Truths to separate from your body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The face of Aeshe (PBUH).&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have a **1-in-6 **chance per template to know one relevant piece of information about anyone you encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The location of the Second Moon.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your tattoos itch when something is being concealed from you. If you would be &lt;strong&gt;surprised,&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The nature of the Stars.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
With a word, you can cause your tattoos to glow with the dim illumination of a starry night. This is sufficient to read by or keep track of your footing, but not increase your radius of vision in darkness. While active, invisible things within arm&amp;rsquo;s reach are revealed to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The geography of the distant North.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can read the current direction and distance to the well at the bottom of the world on the back of your left hand, and are protected as if by &lt;strong&gt;clothing appropriate to the environment&lt;/strong&gt; at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The creation of the Sun.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Your tattoos emit blasts of infrared light when struck. When something deals damage to you it catches fire for &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; damage per round until extinguished. If you are reduced to &lt;strong&gt;0 or lower HP,&lt;/strong&gt; anyone looking in your direction must &lt;strong&gt;SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; or be struck blind for &lt;strong&gt;107&lt;/strong&gt; minutes by an invisible sunburst.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;academic-implements&#34;&gt;Academic Implements &lt;a href=&#34;#academic-implements&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple Mask.&lt;/strong&gt; Depicts an old man, usually grinning. Allows you to see &lt;strong&gt;curse-fog&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;em&gt;maybe, sort of&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;angels,&lt;/strong&gt; and marks you as a member of the Purple priesthood even though that&amp;rsquo;s only about half-true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Academic Robes.&lt;/strong&gt; From a very fancy and reputable institution. Probably worth &lt;strong&gt;10 gp&lt;/strong&gt; if you can find a buyer that knows how much &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; paid for them. 1 slot unless you&amp;rsquo;re wearing em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Burglar&amp;rsquo;s Clothing.&lt;/strong&gt; Dark, close-fitting, has plenty of pockets that are perfectly sized for carrying books, writing implements, and thieves&amp;rsquo; tools situated where they won&amp;rsquo;t get in the way of movement. Covers &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; your entire body, with just enough gaps that it&amp;rsquo;s obvious you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; tattoos but they can&amp;rsquo;t be fully seen. 1 slot unless you&amp;rsquo;re wearing em.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soft Leather Boots and Gloves.&lt;/strong&gt; Supple, comfortable, not all that warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parrying Dagger.&lt;/strong&gt; An elegant weapon, for a more civilized age. A &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapon that counts as a &lt;strong&gt;shield&lt;/strong&gt; in any round you don&amp;rsquo;t attack with it, 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tattoo Kit.&lt;/strong&gt; A variety of needles, inks pressed from rare ingredients. Very efficiently packed. 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing Supplies.&lt;/strong&gt; Quills, pens, brushes, an inkpot, at least one piece of vellum. Useful if you need to write a letter, forge a document, or correct inconsistencies in a book. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Holy Books.&lt;/strong&gt; As the &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html&#34;&gt;Cleric&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;. 1/3rd slot each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List of Grievances.&lt;/strong&gt; Nail them to a church door and they&amp;rsquo;ll cause a whole scene. 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thieves&amp;rsquo; Tools.&lt;/strong&gt; A collection of scalpels, hammers, hand-drills, lockpicks, shims, and the like. 100% guaranteed to have everything you need to do Thief Stuff. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharp Diamond Ring.&lt;/strong&gt; Could cut glass. Worth a cool &lt;strong&gt;20 gp.&lt;/strong&gt; Too small to take up space, really.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very Nice Perfume.&lt;/strong&gt; An exotic combination of scents, very distinctive. Probably nobody you meet will ever have smelled it before, worth &lt;strong&gt;30 gp&lt;/strong&gt; to discerning buyers.  1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rifle. 2d8&lt;/strong&gt; damage at a range of 60&amp;rsquo;, -1 &lt;strong&gt;to-hit&lt;/strong&gt; for every 20&amp;rsquo; after that. Holds two rounds, takes two minutes to reload, and you must purchase the cartridges separately. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musical Instrument.&lt;/strong&gt; You pick which one. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hookah.&lt;/strong&gt; Comes with enough scented tobacco for you to sit around smoking it like an asshole at least 10 times, even if you&amp;rsquo;re sharing it with your friends. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fancy Cushion.&lt;/strong&gt; An excellent seat. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Very Nice Hat.&lt;/strong&gt; Your call if it&amp;rsquo;s appropriate to the region (in case you need to blend in) or wildly inappropriate (in case you need to stand out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Animal Messenger.&lt;/strong&gt; A pigeon, perhaps, or an exceptionally well-trained squirrel or mustelid. Not a crow, raven, rook, or magpie—those can&amp;rsquo;t be trusted, they&amp;rsquo;re too smart. 1&lt;strong&gt;HD,&lt;/strong&gt; 1 slot if you&amp;rsquo;re carrying it around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Waterproof Matches.&lt;/strong&gt; Will ignite and burn in any environment; wet, dry, or airless. Box of 20, 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An oddity. Roll &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; on the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHITHER THE HEART,&lt;/strong&gt; a &lt;strong&gt;medium&lt;/strong&gt; rapier of bronte and chardun. Attracts or is attracted to iron. Sufficient to block ferrous weapons and projectiles if one spends their whole turn parrying, or always hits creatures that have blood and are not wearing ferrous armor. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gleaming Stone.Warm to the touch, slowly shifts through the rainbow of colors, casts light like a torch. Priceless. 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papers declaring you—or at least someone who shares your name and description—a saint of the Purple orthodoxy. If read carefully, they also quite clearly imply that you are dead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bone knife with a long handle and a very small blade—more like a scalpel, really. Capable of cutting through anything physical, and some things not. Can be used as a &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapon that deals only &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; damage but ignores armor or damage reduction, 1/3rd slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A pair of round glasses with completely opaque lenses. Render lies visible and everything else invisible to the wearer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An enormous egg. Neither you nor anyone else knows what it contains. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Exemplary GLOG Classes</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/09/exemplary-glog-classes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 12 Sep 2020 17:46:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/09/exemplary-glog-classes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Being a collection of my favorite GLOG classes written by others, in some sort of not-quite-exact order:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-play-cleric.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Religious classes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - This isn&amp;rsquo;t any single class in particular, but it&amp;rsquo;s my favorite archetype. Read the post, your Clerics and Paladins and Especially Devout Characters Of Any Other Sort will all be leagues better for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Squig&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; particularly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-gun-priest.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gun Priest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - We all know about my love for playing &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/08/let-me-tell-you-about-my-d-characters.html&#34;&gt;dedicated, arrogant, heretic religious nutjobs.&lt;/a&gt; What&amp;rsquo;s better than one of those? One of those with a gun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-sword-swallower.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sword-Swallower&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Just dripping with flavor. If I had read this before writing my &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Sword Witch&lt;/a&gt;, my Sword Witch would be better for it. As it is, I&amp;rsquo;d probably let someone play one of these as an alt-Sword Witch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Absolutely stellar class for any developed and interesting setting. Great integration of narrative and exposition-focused mechanics into a playable class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everything on &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;OSR Discord user deus ex parabola&amp;rsquo;s blog&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; particularly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-unfinished-world-glog-campaign.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anything that interacts with his color-coded heresies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - &amp;ldquo;But Vayra!,&amp;rdquo; you exclaim, &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s a setting element, not a class!&amp;rdquo; And you&amp;rsquo;re right, but that&amp;rsquo;s how good it is. It&amp;rsquo;s the single best piece of worldbuilding I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen committed to text. And anyway, there are &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/06/blessed-even-more-glog-classes-clerics.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;some Clerics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guild Thug&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - The other guilds therein are also good, but the Guild Thug is a standout. There&amp;rsquo;s something incredible to me about the idea of unionized 80&amp;rsquo;s-era action movie baddies, sauntering up to dragons and liches to bop them in the knees and threaten them with destruction of property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metatron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Another excellent example of worldbuilding. Wizards, but they&amp;rsquo;re some sort of absolutely nightmarish cold-war era fictive spy, and also (depending on interpretation) might have been replaced by a spiritual parasite. Put a Metatron in your campaign today. The implications are endless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/05/full-glog-hack-vain-sword.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phlox&amp;rsquo;s Acolyte&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - A refinement of &lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-mind-is-horrible-thing-to-waste.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lexi&amp;rsquo;s magic word-based Psion.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Fixes several issues with the core one while retaining all of the things that made it interesting to me, ties it to a religious system (always a plus), and is just a complete blast to play. Not perfect, yet, maybe, but already great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also the &lt;a href=&#34;https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/08/glog-class-barbarian.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Barbarian-as-Foreigner.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The list of advantages and disadvantages is incredible, awesome, great, very good, excellent, and other superlatives besides. I could see tacking that ability in particular on to other classes, perhaps in place of a &amp;lsquo;race&amp;rsquo; adjustment in an all-human setting, or the like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/11/osr-necromancers.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skerples&amp;rsquo; Necromancer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - Sometimes, a necromancer is just a necromancer. This one has some interesting flavor about talking to dead folks, but the most important part of it is: it allows you to keep permanent undead servants at the cost of keeping your MD expended, or slowly (at risk of Doom) amass a permanent undead army of unlimited size. I consider this ability essential to anything that would call itself a necromancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2019/12/you-sprout-bouquet-of-gun-wielding-arms.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thorinp&amp;rsquo;s Shiva of Guns&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - We know I like &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Gun Witches,&lt;/a&gt; and this is my favorite one that isn&amp;rsquo;t my own. It is particularly weird, in a very good way. &amp;ldquo;You sprout a bouquet of gun wielding arms[&amp;hellip;]&amp;rdquo; indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dungeonantology.com/2020/08/09/glog-class-design/&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jojiro&amp;rsquo;s Iron Salamander&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; - This is a good class design post, much like &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/01/osr-how-to-design-glog-fighters.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&amp;rsquo;s earlier one&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; but my favorite thing about it is this particular Fighter example: The Iron Salamander. Great stuff. Eminently flavorful. Powerful. Interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, &lt;strong&gt;what are &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; favorite GLOG classes written by others?&lt;/strong&gt; I know GLOG is somewhat imperfect for this question, as it encourages stealing bits and naturally your favorite version of a class will be the one that you cobbled together with parts of others, so perhaps it&amp;rsquo;s best to think of it instead as: &lt;strong&gt;What GLOG classes most inspire you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other people have made this post, too!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://slugsandsilver.blogspot.com/2020/09/the-best-glog-classes.html&#34;&gt;Of Slugs and Silver (Ancalagon_TB)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://bugbearslug.blogspot.com/2020/09/my-favourite-glog-classes.html&#34;&gt;Bugbear Slug (BaaL)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>CANYON: A one-page solo RPG</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/08/canyon-one-page-solo-rpg.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 14 Aug 2020 15:07:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/08/canyon-one-page-solo-rpg.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The inimitable Luther Gutekunst of &lt;a href=&#34;https://archons-court.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Archon&amp;rsquo;s Court&lt;/a&gt; posted a &lt;a href=&#34;https://archons-court.blogspot.com/2020/08/canyon-200-word-rpg.html&#34;&gt;200-word RPG&lt;/a&gt; today. Here&amp;rsquo;s his description:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mehUbmM1tSiGKDNwBwBl6tIZY9lCfvIc/view&#34;&gt;Canyon&lt;/a&gt; is a duet game about resource management and unexpected solutions, set in a largely undescribed post-apocalypse. I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten to test it yet, but I&amp;rsquo;d like to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good. I played a test run. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t supposed to be a solo RPG, but the way the ghoul acts seemed so perfect for scripting that I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but think of it as one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A handful of discord messages, a hastily googled public domain stock photo, and an hour and a half in photoshop later, I turned it into a one-page solo game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/qWwrROZ.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/qWwrROZ.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/qWwrROZ.png&#34;&gt;Click&lt;/a&gt; for big, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vXM1RvUZAuzxOt4-VvmIKxKOjAwdEA39/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for PDF.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like all solo RPGs, this one probably requires a little bit of interpretation on the part of the player/GM - but not much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case it helps, here are two playtest reports with very slight differences in interpretation. Both are correct:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pastebin.com/raw/vfug6KGQ&#34;&gt;Mine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://pastebin.com/raw/uE8TA60V&#34;&gt;Archon&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>Let Me Tell You About My D&amp;D Character(s)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/08/let-me-tell-you-about-my-d-characters.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 08 Aug 2020 16:28:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/08/let-me-tell-you-about-my-d-characters.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;DandyMan over at Throne of Salt posted &lt;a href=&#34;https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/2020/08/all-my-other-characters.html&#34;&gt;a whole bunch of their old characters&lt;/a&gt; and it got me thinking I should do that. I don&amp;rsquo;t have the character sheets, but I&amp;rsquo;ll see if I can assemble an approximate timeline of my life in TTRPG characters regardless!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I fully expect nobody will read this, as it is both deeply personal and by far the longest post on my blog to date (not counting the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain PHB&lt;/a&gt; I guess, if you include linked documents). Ah well, it was a fun trip down memory lane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-mists-of-history-c-2000&#34;&gt;The Mists of History (c. 2000) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-mists-of-history-c-2000&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;I started playing D&amp;amp;D with the red box, which my parents bought for me at a garage sale or thrift store when I was in elementary school and about 7 years old. I played one or two abortive games with the example dungeon in the box. I don&amp;rsquo;t even remember who DM&amp;rsquo;d - it might have been me! I do remember the party being TPK&amp;rsquo;d by the fucking Carrion Crawler, however. And that the teacher I had roped into playing with me rolled a Magic-User with 1 HP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did not play red box again. Which is too bad, because it managed to teach a 7-year-old me what D&amp;amp;D was and more or less how to play it - albeit with the help of an older student and a teacher who had both also never played before. That&amp;rsquo;s pretty incredible!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;regrettable-youth-c-2001-2005&#34;&gt;Regrettable Youth (c. 2001-2005) &lt;a href=&#34;#regrettable-youth-c-2001-2005&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Middle school! One of my friends knew what D&amp;amp;D was, and he ran a game that was certainly not D&amp;amp;D, played with our imaginations and absolutely no dice, books, pencils, or paper. I remember it cribbing heavily from Warcraft 3 and a little bit from like, &lt;strong&gt;Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&lt;/strong&gt;, which I had forgotten the name of and my (genius) partner somehow managed to identify from the extremely flawed description I gave them while writing this: &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;what was the like, PS2 or PS2-era PC game with the vampire guy who was ugly and had a big scarf over his face? I don&amp;rsquo;t think it was Devil May Cry but it might have played like it&amp;hellip; I wanna say &amp;ldquo;soul eater&amp;rdquo; but apparently that&amp;rsquo;s an anime fighting game&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We did not ever play a tabletop game with rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;foucault-quote-c-2006-2007&#34;&gt;&lt;!-- raw HTML omitted --&gt; (c. 2006-2007) &lt;a href=&#34;#foucault-quote-c-2006-2007&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;High school! 3.5e was out, I was old enough and nerdy enough to understand it, and there were people who played nearly every day! None of our games played &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; school lasted very long, but I did play in one fairly successful campaign run outside of school, near the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Bob, Human Fighter.&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, I played a (presumably white) male human fighter named Bob, in one of many short-lived school games. He started at level 5 and was eaten by a vampire in his first or second session. He is one of the only characters of this era I remember.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - CN Goliath.&lt;/strong&gt; All I remember is playing a goliath and taking Monkey Grip for a stupendously oversized weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Deep Imaskari Transmuter.&lt;/strong&gt; Created for a game outside of school, a high-level (10th?) dungeon crawl through some module or other. Discovered an illusory wall concealing a tunnel, walked through it, was promptly bitten by a giant spider, and succumbed to the poison - all within the space of the first session. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember if the game lasted beyond that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e -&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t remember my character at all but we tried to play Expedition to Undermountain at least twice. I think I was an artificer at least one of those times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Spellscale Sorcerer.&lt;/strong&gt; Focused on fire magic, blew things up in a brief campaign run by my girlfriend at the time and including only one other player (who was playing a duskblade of a race I forget). &lt;strong&gt;The campaign was notable for being set on a world comprised of nothing but a single, immense &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;&amp;hellip; a concept which obviously left a lasting impression on me.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shadowrun 3e - Troll. We played Shadowrun at least once. I think it would have been 3e, at the time. I was a heavily augmented troll, I remember taking a shotgun blast in the chest from a Lone Star agent and jumping out of a 3rd story window. I think I was fine after both, but we never played again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - 9² (pronounced &amp;ldquo;nine squared&amp;rdquo;), LE Warforged Monk/Rogue.&lt;/strong&gt; Relied on a generous reading of the Monkey Grip feat that let it apply to Battlefists, a Warforged item that gave you a giant fist. I think I combined it with some other ability for a truly gigantic fist - as large as my character, because of course 3.5e has rules to determine how big a weapon is. 9² also had Rogue levels, the feat that allowed rogue and monk levels to stack for Sneak Attack or Flurry of Blows or something, and the Exemplars of Evil alternate Monk class feature that allows one round of invisibility on a three-round cooldown - which I recall I decided was too powerful to use as written (it was) so I stated that 9² would invariably use it on cooldown - flickering in and out of view on a regular timer like some sort of multidimensional fluorescent on the fritz. As an explanation for why 9² possessed these abilities, they were a construct created by some great extradimensional evil (&amp;ldquo;the old gods&amp;rdquo;) and sent to the campaign setting to understand, consume, and eventually destroy it. I mostly roleplayed this by making a point to scoop the warm brains out of everything I killed and jam them into a grate in the front of my warforged skull to be incinerated. Unfortunately, I don&amp;rsquo;t think the campaign lasted beyond a handful of sessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Rage McCoy, CE Strongheart Halfling Rogue.&lt;/strong&gt; Created for an out-of-school dungeoncrawling campaign, I think the first successfully long-lived campaign that I participated in. Rage was mechanically a Strongheart Halfling, but narratively a creature born of the Infinite Layers of the Abyss - after all, it stands to reason that if the abyss is truly infinite (it is) then races exactly alike to those on the material plane would exist somewhere in it. I had a whole backstory about how and why he was present on the Prime Material, but I don&amp;rsquo;t remember it - something about being banished by a demon lord or powerful sorcerer, and questing to find a way back home to kill it. A very small, very angry, extremely deadly halfling, who was briefly possessed by a bloodthirsty cursed hammer and, I think, died to a gargoyle. I (much) later recycled this character concept for &lt;strong&gt;Skin,&lt;/strong&gt; a character in an entirely different game, so I definitely liked it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Sol, CG or NG Human Cleric.&lt;/strong&gt; I believe this was the character I played after Rage died in the same campaign, and he was a fairly standard holy-warrior cleric type - boosted by the fact that we were 7th or 8th level by then and he could be a twelve-foot titan of divine might with full base attack bonus 24/7 thanks to Divine Metamagic. I recycle this guy as an NPC often, and he might have been the start of my love for playing &lt;strong&gt;bombastic and extraordinarily confident heretical religious nutjobs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know this is a bit of a heretical opinion among OSR grogs, but 3.5e remains my favorite version of D&amp;amp;D to this day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-innocence-of-youth-c-2008-2010&#34;&gt;The Innocence of Youth (c. 2008-2010) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-innocence-of-youth-c-2008-2010&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 16 I dropped out of high school, got a job, and moved in with my girlfriend at the time. She ran a very long campaign with several of our mutual friends, which is to date the only long-term D&amp;amp;D campaign I&amp;rsquo;ve played in that actually managed to reach a conclusion. I&amp;rsquo;ve run games (both D&amp;amp;D and not) that reached a suitably climactic endpoint, and I&amp;rsquo;ve played in non-D&amp;amp;D games that did, but this remains the only D&amp;amp;D game I was a player in which achieved that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Grittinius Vox Vercettitrix (&amp;ldquo;Vox&amp;rdquo;), TN Wood Elf Barbarian.&lt;/strong&gt; Oh my god. This was a whole &lt;em&gt;thing.&lt;/em&gt; I found the Obsidian Portal page for this campaign. Unfortunately it looks like we stopped using it after four sessions - although the campaign continued for the better part of a year, going from 4th to 9th level. I&amp;rsquo;ll see what I can remember.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vox&amp;rsquo;s character was based almost entirely, from what I can remember, on &lt;strong&gt;(NSFW)&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oglaf.com/son-of-kronar/&#34;&gt;Kronar of Oglaf&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t click that link if you&amp;rsquo;re a child.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His description contained the phrase &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Clad in a small leather pouch and a large shirt of brilliant silver mail, he strikes a figure both intimidating and resplendent with masculine sensuality.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;, which might be the single best line of prose I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His &amp;lsquo;bio&amp;rsquo; was this, which is mostly notable for proving that my sense of humor hasn&amp;rsquo;t changed &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; in the intervening almost-exactly-a-decade, since it&amp;rsquo;s one of the funniest things I&amp;rsquo;ve ever written I think: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/1xoMD7k.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/1xoMD7k.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately below that, there was a link to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PUZ3kupYJTXAIJ8qlnqqWsh4JD77rFCnQE2UBv2Xrg/edit&#34;&gt;4-page backstory of incredibly purple prose.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I described his wood elf (more of a &amp;lsquo;snow elf&amp;rsquo; really) tribe as generally making use of two weapons - the &lt;strong&gt;long knife&lt;/strong&gt; and the &lt;strong&gt;hunting spear&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/7Rn5CH8.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/7Rn5CH8.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;long knife&amp;rdquo; is a greatsword, the &amp;ldquo;hunting spear&amp;rdquo; is a glaive. I thought this was tremendously funny as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a wood elf (STR bonus) barbarian (with Whirling Frenzy and Lion Totem - the Complete Champion version) with Leap Attack and such, he was an absolute fucking terror.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His main character trait was aggressively intimidating people into telling him &amp;ldquo;everything they know about dragons&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Vox died (I think he leap attacked right off of the deck of an airship, it was a glorious death) around level 6 or 7, and I had to make a new character.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - ???? (&amp;ldquo;Arbor&amp;rdquo;), LE Grey Elf Psion/Thrallherd.&lt;/strong&gt; Unfortunately this was after we stopped using Obsidian Portal for the campaign, so I&amp;rsquo;ve lost most of the details for my followup to Vox. What I do remember:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was a member of the shaman caste of the same viking-esque elf tribe as Vox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being a shaman, he used the traditional weapon of the caste - the Ame spirit axe (it was a greataxe). Mostly for the x3 crit on coup de grace, because as a psion he mainly fought by rendering opponents helpless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a thrall who was basically mini-Vox, because of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This campaign had a fairly uncontested main character - one of us was an Aasimar cleric of nature and light named Evayna, a good person by any metric, and generally played the &amp;lsquo;straight man&amp;rsquo; to our collective comedic urges and attempted derails and kept us on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main goal of the campaign was to acquire some sort of incredibly powerful magic amulet, which would end the world and allow us to remake it according to our whims. It was basically a foregone conclusion that the cleric, Evayna, would be the one to do this since she was the only person in probably the entire campaign setting that could be trusted with that sort of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very end of the campaign, we fought the BBEG - some sort of ancient nightmare dragon. There was a climactic battle, Evayna was wounded but not dead, and finally, our foe was brought down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m sure you can see where this is going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arbor stole the amulet from Evayna&amp;rsquo;s weakened grasp at the last moment, triggering its ability and ending the world only to remake it into an icy crucible of suffering and hardship exactly like the snowy island he was born on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel kinda bad about that now, but damn was it ever fun at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WEG Star Wars D6 - Zlotto Malchik, Toydarian.&lt;/strong&gt; An attempt to play an inversion of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watto#Allegations_of_antisemitism&#34;&gt;anti-semitic caricature&lt;/a&gt; of Watto in the Phantom Menace, backed up by the &lt;a href=&#34;http://d6holocron.com/wiki/index.php?title=Toydarian&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt; combat-related stats&lt;/a&gt; given to Toydarians by some kind D6Holocron editor. Since the Empire are (blatantly) Space Nazis crossed with the British Empire, Zlotto was a grizzled mercenary veteran in the model of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B.J._Blazkowicz&#34;&gt;B.J. Blazkowicz&lt;/a&gt;, just with a little pot belly and wings. Unfortunately that campaign only lasted a handful of sessions, but it inspired in me a deep love for the WEG SWD6 system which lives on in my heart to this day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-early-modern-era-c-2016-2019&#34;&gt;The Early Modern Era (c. 2016-2019) &lt;a href=&#34;#the-early-modern-era-c-2016-2019&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There followed quite a long time (six years? ish?) where I didn&amp;rsquo;t play in any games, though I did run several games of &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/03/random-generators-for-apocalypse-and.html&#34;&gt;a post-apocalyptic d20hack that I should really type up for the blog some day, but here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the generators I used to stock it for the time being.&lt;/a&gt; One of the most positive outcomes of this was that in doing so I introduced a friend to the wonders of TTRPGs, and he later went on to run several cyberpunk and time-traveling weirdo games using the same system. The latter three characters below were for his games, the first one was for a Roll20 campaign of FFG Star Wars that I played with some pals from leftbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5e - ????, ?? Elven Cleric.&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;rsquo;t remember this game at all, and it might have been slightly before 2016. I played a single session, was bitterly disappointed in the generic fantasy setting of the campaign, the GM&amp;rsquo;s style, and the 5e rules, and never went back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FFG Star Wars - Eka, Droideka.&lt;/strong&gt; Eka was a &lt;a href=&#34;https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Droideka&#34;&gt;Destroyer Droid&lt;/a&gt; and veteran of the Clone Wars, rescued from the scrapheap by a rogue Nemoidian engineer named Puf Sriiko during/after the fall of the Trade Federation and spirited away to some backwater planet where it became one of the founding members of a Rebel cell. One notable trait was that it had a vocalizer module pulled from a riot control droid vehicle, so it had two volumes: &amp;ldquo;loud&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;ear-shattering&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This campaign inspires pride in me, not a strange combination of laughter and shame like the one Vox was a part of, so I&amp;rsquo;ll post some direct links to the Obsidian Portal for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a (much shorter than Vox&amp;rsquo;s, thankfully) little &lt;a href=&#34;https://subterraneanfire.obsidianportal.com/wikis/eka&#34;&gt;backstory&lt;/a&gt; as to why Eka was sentient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign involved us (quite quickly, actually) staging a large-scale prison break at the Imperial detainment facilities on the planet where we started, seizing a custom luxury megaliner, and assembling a rag-tag &lt;a href=&#34;https://subterraneanfire.obsidianportal.com/wikis/space-fleet&#34;&gt;flotilla&lt;/a&gt; around it for our &lt;a href=&#34;https://subterraneanfire.obsidianportal.com/wikis/order-of-battle&#34;&gt;little Rebel army known as &amp;ldquo;The Nameless&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wrote a few notes on &lt;a href=&#34;https://subterraneanfire.obsidianportal.com/wikis/active-service-unit&#34;&gt;our organization&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://subterraneanfire.obsidianportal.com/wikis/the-general-assembly&#34;&gt;the charter for it&lt;/a&gt;, the former largely from my thoughts on how a self-sufficient Anarchist military force might actually be organized for guerrilla warfare and the latter largely from some research notes on historical pirate charters in the age of sail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game has been in stasis for at least two years now, but I still hold out hope it will be revived some day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Cops - Sunflower Jade Ocean (&amp;ldquo;Sunny&amp;rdquo;), US Marine/Stoner/Pilot/Wasted Youth.&lt;/strong&gt; Sunny was a gifted child born to a pair of neo-hippies (hence the name). Due to never being vaccinated, he had a close brush with death as an infant and never fully recovered (he had like, 6 CON). He flew a crop duster for his parents&amp;rsquo; vineyard before he was drafted, acquiring some flight skills, but wasted them (as he did his innate grasp of technology and generally amazing hand-eye coordination and physical dexterity) by spending his free time getting high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The core conceit of Time Cops was that our party were a small band of losers drafted into the USMC as a result of some nightmare war with Russia in 2026 (this game started around when it looked like Hillary was going to win), who were quickly press-ganged into some time traveling shenanigans by a secret government organization, rescuing a young scientist named &lt;strong&gt;Teddy&lt;/strong&gt; and escaping into the past just as the first ICBMs hit San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although the campaign was called &amp;ldquo;Time Cops&amp;rdquo;, we mostly ended up shooting and and being shot at by cops, actually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The campaign lasted a very long time, and was one of the more fun games I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pacifica - Janus &amp;ldquo;Sick Boy&amp;rdquo; Stanislawski, Old Tech Enthusiast, Self-Destructive Drug Addict, Smart Aleck, Soundcloud Rapper, Sharpshooter.&lt;/strong&gt; Sick Boy was a very similar character to Sunny in many ways. He had essentially the same statline, and his story followed approximately the same beats - signing up with the Corporate Coalition in the 2040s, he was shipped to Denver to fight the US government in the crisis that won the megacorps collective extraterritoriality and destroyed what of the state&amp;rsquo;s little legitimacy was left at that point. Unfortunately, he was hit with some sort of bioweapon, and nearly died before even seeing combat. Treated at a military hospital, he was discharged immediately once he had stabilized, and cut off from further corporate aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sick Boy had probably the deepest characterization and best arc of any character I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played, going from a relatively incompetent layabout to a genuine revolutionary leader. Along the way I learned a lot about him - his struggling with and eventual acceptance of his sexuality, his gradual move from self-destruction to self-actualization and improvement, his freedom from drug addiction (fraught with several relapses), and his appreciation for high-powered plasma rail rifles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pacifica was also run with the ruleset I designed for my post-apocalyptic game, but was set in a more traditional cyberpunk world. The campaign ran for more than two years and spanned themes from low-level gang warfare, to Shadowrun-like deniable asset missions, to consolidation of our hold over territory, to liberation of an entire city from its corporate overlords in, essentially, a massive ground war. It was immensely satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Time Cops 2 - Skin, Raider.&lt;/strong&gt; Skin was a character for the sequel to Time Cops. He was a small, angry man (or boy?) of indeterminate age and race, plucked from the post-apocalyptic setting I ran several campaigns in - we decided that since Time Cops was a pastiche of everything, it made sense for it to have tendrils in every game we had run or would run in the future from that point, and so every PC in the sequel came from a different timeline. He was very similar to &lt;strong&gt;Rage&lt;/strong&gt; in many ways, but I had a lot of fun with characterizing him further. He didn&amp;rsquo;t have quite the same arc as Sick Boy, but I was still very pleased with it - he developed from a frantic, angry survivalist who couldn&amp;rsquo;t read and never thought of anything beyond his next meal, to a more coldly melancholic figure who was resigned to the futility of trying to fix time itself but determined to keep trying to win, literally, a better future for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;present-day-c-2020&#34;&gt;Present Day (c. 2020) &lt;a href=&#34;#present-day-c-2020&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we get to the characters I&amp;rsquo;m either currently playing, or was playing in games within this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starfinder - Saros “BADSTAR” al-Hariq bint Ayasellah Mihelar Khalidlah, Bastard Princess of the City of Brass, LE Ifrit Solarian Noble Scion.&lt;/strong&gt; A friend of mine from the Starsector community started a Starfinder PbP campaign at level 3, so naturally I rolled up a character with an incredibly overblown backstory involving her being, yes, literally the bastard princess of the City of Brass, and also time travel. I think I did this partially out of protest at Starfinder being one o&amp;rsquo; them newfangled D&amp;amp;Ds where PCs never die. I had a whole two-paragraph copy/paste written for a magical girl transformation sequence where she summons her Solarian sword and another one for her &amp;ldquo;finishing move&amp;rdquo;, It was glorious and I got to use each one about twice, since the campaign proceeded through one &amp;ldquo;mission&amp;rdquo; and then went on indefinite hiatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/UaKiwXg.png&#34;&gt;I made this photoshop of her.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lancer - Hex, Horus/IPS-Northstar Pilot (Pegasus/Raleigh Mech).&lt;/strong&gt; Made for a Roll20 campaign set in the world of Starsector with the addition of Lancer mechs. Had a bit of cool story about being a cloned Knight of Westernesse who was brutally fucked around by Alpha-level AI during some mission to the Fringe, but never really got to explore it - the GM didn&amp;rsquo;t really understand the rhythm of Lancer and the game was extremely unsatisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/kgBn3Ns.png&#34;&gt;I made this photoshop of her &amp;lsquo;mech.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.5e - Jesh the Accursed, CG/CN Dragonborn Mongrelfolk Dragonfire Adept.&lt;/strong&gt; I joined a PbP 3.5e server that was running several concurrent games with different GMs in a shared homebrew Forgotten Realms campaign setting, and made a DFA because I wanted to flex those CharOp muscles without ruining the game for the rest of the players in the game I joined (who were, I think, two Fighters and a Samurai). Jesh was formerly a famed paladin of Bahamut, who had been struck down and cursed by a great evil and now wandered the world in penance for her failure. I had started her as CG but planned to switch her over to CE relatively quickly (helped along by one of the first engagements we had being killing some sort of Lovecraftian elder god thing, which disillusioned her greatly) to become an Ur-Priest. The character went well, I was happy with her and she contributed hugely to a couple of fights without overshadowing anyone, but I quit after only a handful of sessions because the GM, while meaning well, was frankly incompetent. That was the closest I ever got to the RPG horror stories I hear about 4e/5e campaigns that are just a railroad of setpiece battles with very little player agency between them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BFRPG/GLOG - Many Bugbears.&lt;/strong&gt; I joined &lt;a href=&#34;http://wizzzargh.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Wizzzargh&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a&gt; open table campaign (BFRPG but allowing GLOG classes) during an intra-party civil war, which in retrospect was probably a mistake. I rolled up Many Goblins, which was upgraded to Many Bugbears on account of there already being some bugbears around, and was promptly involved in a quadruple-cross plot by one of the players, which in retrospect was &lt;em&gt;definitely&lt;/em&gt; a mistake - especially because we promptly lost the civil war! The Many Bugbears were summarily executed to a bugbear, and the last one fled into the mirror realm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really wish I hadn&amp;rsquo;t done that, tbh. The quadruple-cross plot part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BFRPG/GLOG - Mani skel Etons, Fassulian Human Necromancer (Skerples&amp;rsquo; version).&lt;/strong&gt; My replacement character, after the resolution of the civil war, was Mani - a greenskinned noble necromancer from Fassulia, a desert country that forbids necromancy. I&amp;rsquo;m very fond of her, played her for a few sessions and she&amp;rsquo;s still technically playable, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t been able to keep up with the &lt;em&gt;breakneck&lt;/em&gt; pace of the game for quite a while now so she remains in stasis. She had a lovely text accent, affect of humming constantly, and unquenchable curiousity, which I picked up from another player in the Starfinder game I played Saros in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/dCxfLbz.png&#34;&gt;I made this photoshop of her.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BFRPG - Magpie Burnt-Face, Dwarf Cleric.&lt;/strong&gt; Created for another BFRPG game on the same server but run by a different person, going through an edited version of &lt;strong&gt;Peril of the Purple Planet&lt;/strong&gt;, a DCC module, and played for two or three sessions. Also still technically alive, but in stasis for the same reason of it being hard to keep up with the open table for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/yQXUohH.png&#34;&gt;I made this photoshop of her.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/05/full-glog-hack-vain-sword.html&#34;&gt;Vain the Sword&lt;/a&gt; - Panko Fang, Gnoll &lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/06/a-mind-is-horrible-thing-to-waste.html&#34;&gt;Acolyte&lt;/a&gt; of Iron.&lt;/strong&gt; A crochety old gnoll who worships an anti-god devoted to the destruction of all things and the final death of souls. A sort of weird wise man, who tells koans to rocks, lies to mercenaries, shattered his own legs with a WORD of power once, and is utterly assured that his philosophies are correct. He fully fits the mold of &amp;ldquo;bombastic and extraordinarily confident heretical religious nutjob&amp;rdquo; and I love him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-unfinished-world-glog-campaign.html&#34;&gt;G20&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/no-light-no-warmth-glog-expedition-new.html&#34;&gt;NO LIGHT NO WARMTH&lt;/a&gt; - Alpha Priest, Umbran &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/no-light-no-warmth-oiled-paladin-class.html&#34;&gt;Oiled Paladin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; Is it a conflict of interest to play a class I made? Maybe, but I&amp;rsquo;m having a grand time. She was created for deus ex parabola&amp;rsquo;s Face campaign, fully fits the mold of &amp;ldquo;bombastic and extraordinarily confident heretical religious nutjob&amp;rdquo;, and she&amp;rsquo;s one of my favorite characters I&amp;rsquo;ve ever played.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://archons-court.blogspot.com/search/label/Sunless%20Horizon&#34;&gt;Sunless Horizon&lt;/a&gt; - Eni Léashvath, Iklen Jackal.&lt;/strong&gt; After playing Panko and Alpha, I realized I had hit upon a stellar formula for characters I love to play, so naturally when I was invited to the Sunless Horizon playtest game and saw there was a phenotype who had been created to be priests for the malign super-AI that governs Ein Soph and serves as its god I jumped at that chance. Eni is sort of a reptilian sci-fi restatement of Panko, fully fits the mold of &amp;ldquo;bombastic and extraordinarily confident heretical religious nutjob&amp;rdquo;, and I greatly enjoy playing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;observations&#34;&gt;Observations &lt;a href=&#34;#observations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;What have I learned by typing this?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I love 3.5e, it&amp;rsquo;s my favorite TSR/WOTC D&amp;amp;D game. Both earlier and later editions just feel lacking to me. Basic (not ECMI or /X, just B) is a close second, I suppose, but if I wanted to play Basic I&amp;rsquo;d play OSE and not a TSR product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My early characters, even the long-running ones, had a certain immaturity to them. But I reimagined some of those earlier tropes into more complex characters later (Rage -&amp;gt; Skin, Sol -&amp;gt; Panko, Alpha, and Eni, Vox -&amp;gt; Saros kind of in a way) and found them immensely satisfying.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve played most &amp;lsquo;archetypes&amp;rsquo; over the years. Wizards are probably my least favorite, but I do like Mani a lot, so that&amp;rsquo;s not a constant. I&amp;rsquo;ve done a lot of stabby/snipey roguish types (Rage, Sunny, Sick Boy, and Skin all fit this mold), skilled and fearsome noble warriors (Vox, Saros, plus some I never got to play), and bombastic and extraordinarily confident heretical religious nutjobs (Sol, Pano, Alpha, Eni), and those are definitely my favorite tropes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is a fun thing to do and &lt;strong&gt;you should make a post like this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/07/glog-random-class-generator.html&#34;&gt;my last post&lt;/a&gt; there have been like, at least four more batches of GLOG microclasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The posts relevant to this that are known to me are collected here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/07/i-wrote-list-of-fifty-class-names-and.html&#34;&gt;The first post (deus ex parabola)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/07/99-problems-more-glog-micro-classes.html&#34;&gt;More (deus ex parabola)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/07/parabolas-50-glog-classes-part-1.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&amp;rsquo;s take on the first 15 (Phlox)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/07/parabolas-action-50-part-2-play-report.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&amp;rsquo;s take on the next 15 (Phlox)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/07/parabolas-action-50-part-3.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&amp;rsquo;s take on the third 15 (Phlox)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/07/microclass-compendium-action-50-part-4.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&amp;rsquo;s compilation of More (Phlox)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t have a link but &lt;a href=&#34;https://dungeonantology.com/&#34;&gt;Jojiro&lt;/a&gt; gave us upwards of a hundred more names and we did those too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because I am a slave to the zeitgeist, I compiled &lt;em&gt;all of them&lt;/em&gt; into a single generator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be warned, it is &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; less coherent than the last one. I may prune it a bit later - it was actually doing great until I added the last batch.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For this story to make sense, I&amp;rsquo;ll have to begin at the beginning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actually, scratch that, it&amp;rsquo;ll make less sense if I do. I&amp;rsquo;m going to do it anyway, of course. Bear with me here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, a bunch of people in Victorian Britain wrote terrible novels&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, that&amp;rsquo;s too early. Let me start over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, which was about five years ago, &lt;a href=&#34;https://udan-adan.blogspot.com/2017/06/the-heads-of-headless-penny-dreadful.html&#34;&gt;Joseph Manola posted a list of Victorian &amp;ldquo;penny dreadful&amp;rdquo; novel titles.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I think, &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;OSR discord user deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt; took that list and transformed it into potential class names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the course of that day, &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;OSR discord user deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/07/parabolas-50-glog-classes-part-1.html&#34;&gt;Phlox&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;http://wordsforyellow.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Lynn&lt;/a&gt;, Gorinch, &lt;a href=&#34;https://xenophonsramblings.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Xeno&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophon&#34;&gt;phon of Athens&lt;/a&gt;, Purplecthulu, &lt;a href=&#34;https://oblidisideryptch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Oblidisideryptch&lt;/a&gt;, and I turned them into (rough) class templates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then deus ex parabola &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/07/i-wrote-list-of-fifty-class-names-and.html&#34;&gt;posted them on his blog.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&amp;hellip;And then &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; turned it into a random generator that mashes them all together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;](&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=1Qv45r1A&#34;&gt;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=1Qv45r1A&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOkqMpEv92s/XwQrTqI_wGI/AAAAAAAApj0/roV4AL8Bc6wvYdJwBdD--RZw8StGE7xwACLcBGAsYHQ/s778/unknown.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ZOkqMpEv92s/XwQrTqI_wGI/AAAAAAAApj0/roV4AL8Bc6wvYdJwBdD--RZw8StGE7xwACLcBGAsYHQ/s320/unknown.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=1Qv45r1A&#34;&gt;It produces things like &lt;strong&gt;this.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s surprisingly coherent sometimes. Maybe about a third of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not sorry for what I have done and I hope it brings anyone who reads this joy and pain in equal measure. Post your favorite things it&amp;rsquo;s come up with!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLOG for Gretchlings: Or, Notes Towards a More Diverse Tabletop Roleplaying Community</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/07/glog-for-gretchlings-or-notes-towards.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Jul 2020 21:38:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/07/glog-for-gretchlings-or-notes-towards.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This post is intended to be a central resource that explains the GLOG, extolls its virtues, and most importantly: &lt;strong&gt;Showcases how easily you can produce your own GLOGhack; participate in the immense, active, and ever-growing community; claim a little piece of the TTRPG world for your own; and stop system-hopping between corporate-published games that don&amp;rsquo;t meet all of your needs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-the-glog&#34;&gt;What is the GLOG? &lt;a href=&#34;#what-is-the-glog&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GLOG (short for &lt;strong&gt;Goblin Laws of Gaming&lt;/strong&gt;) originated with an &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;innovative yet incomplete ruleset posted by Arnold K. over at goblinpunch&lt;/a&gt;, but it has since evolved far beyond that. It&amp;rsquo;s less a single system and more of &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-tao-of-glog.html&#34;&gt;a philosophy,&lt;/a&gt; one that emphasizes the agency of individual game runners in making the system their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To date, the best published summary of the GLOG (as community, not as specific system) might be &lt;a href=&#34;https://diyanddragons.blogspot.com/2019/03/who-is-glogosphere.html&#34;&gt;this post on DIY &amp;amp; Dragons from early 2019&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a definite do-it-yourself / make-it-your-own sensibility across these blogs. One person will write a new class, and a half-dozen people will write supporting material for it or incorporate it directly into their setting, and a half-dozen more will write modified versions of the original to better suit their own sensibilities. Nothing is sacred, nothing is off-limits, everything can be improved, or at least customized, including the rules themselves, which is why so many GLOGgers have their own houserules documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--a5jEhJzefo/XwJNgWevaYI/AAAAAAAApik/-OAZY-lwnC4p1UuihLDEmGNt2PMsfnUTgCLcBGAsYHQ/s381/gretchling.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--a5jEhJzefo/XwJNgWevaYI/AAAAAAAApik/-OAZY-lwnC4p1UuihLDEmGNt2PMsfnUTgCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/gretchling.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/gretchlings-and-grues.html&#34;&gt;gretchling&lt;/a&gt;, the mascot of the GLOGosphere. By reading this, you are becoming one, also known as a &lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-glogblin.html&#34;&gt;GLOGblin&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The best summary of the &amp;ldquo;original GLOG&amp;rdquo; might be &lt;a href=&#34;https://crateredland.blogspot.com/p/whats-this-glog-thing.html&#34;&gt;this post by Lexi over at A Blasted, Cratered Land.&lt;/a&gt; Insofar as the GLOG has a set of standards or conventions that unify its multitudinous children, they might be these:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple, modular design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus on low-level play&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A trademark magic system&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A wealth of character options, usually in the form of short &amp;ldquo;template&amp;rdquo;-based classes - while you can (in many hacks) potentially level up infinitely, your actual &amp;ldquo;class levels&amp;rdquo; are condensed down to (usually) four, with simple 3.5e or 5e-like multiclassing if you want it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, they are not laws. I&amp;rsquo;m sure I can name at least one GLOGhack that omits each standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arnold&amp;rsquo;s ruleset inspired - and continues to inspire - people in a vast, diverse, and decentralized community to create their own hacks, largely because:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s free&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s short&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s good&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&amp;ldquo;It feels like something a normal human wrote, rather than a divinely inspired game designer from planet Esoteric Brilliance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That last is a quote from Skerples, himself a noted GLOGblin, and I think it explains a lot of the GLOG&amp;rsquo;s appeal. The original GLOG is such a mess that it really &lt;em&gt;motivates&lt;/em&gt; people to make it their own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o9zim51cxxk/XwJVJoy9qMI/AAAAAAAApjM/6hKVjxsoHFU_fUeDcivlQcyjuj3tLpTngCLcBGAsYHQ/s1145/Untitled-1.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-o9zim51cxxk/XwJVJoy9qMI/AAAAAAAApjM/6hKVjxsoHFU_fUeDcivlQcyjuj3tLpTngCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/Untitled-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dialogue on the nature of GLOG. A diaGLOGue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You look at it, in its fragmented state, and realize that it &lt;em&gt;has been used to run successful games,&lt;/em&gt; and you think, &amp;ldquo;Hey, I could write this.&amp;rdquo; And then you &lt;strong&gt;do,&lt;/strong&gt; and the GLOGlist grows by one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A GLOGhack doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to include much, or indeed &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of the original GLOG. To quote Arnold K.:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--JqJXvbc8h8/XwJOoBTilVI/AAAAAAAApi4/mQEzCXc_kZYqW8pIFoaDJrqhYXLtf3LDwCK4BGAsYHg/s530/Annotation%2B2020-07-05%2B150437.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--JqJXvbc8h8/XwJOoBTilVI/AAAAAAAApi4/mQEzCXc_kZYqW8pIFoaDJrqhYXLtf3LDwCK4BGAsYHg/s320/Annotation%2B2020-07-05%2B150437.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna print this out and frame it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For further reading on the GLOG itself, one might consult this duo of Skerples&amp;rsquo; posts:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/03/osr-glog-review.html&#34;&gt;Review of the original GLOG ruleset.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/02/osr-grand-glog-playtesting-review.html&#34;&gt;Playtesting notes after ~50 sessions and writing the first version of his own GLOGhack.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;why-write-a-gloghack&#34;&gt;Why write a GLOGhack? &lt;a href=&#34;#why-write-a-gloghack&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-it-will-be-your-own&#34;&gt;1) It will be your own. &lt;a href=&#34;#1-it-will-be-your-own&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the core and most important reason. Even if you don&amp;rsquo;t care about the politics of Wizards of the Coast, having your own game means &lt;strong&gt;freedom.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the first draft of your rules isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect or you find that some mechanic you&amp;rsquo;re using doesn&amp;rsquo;t work great at your table, &lt;em&gt;that&amp;rsquo;s fine.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Playing is more important than perfection,&lt;/strong&gt; and since it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;your game&lt;/em&gt; you&amp;rsquo;re empowered to add in new things, swap out other parts, remove stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit, and &lt;strong&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s no twitter account for your players to point to and say, &amp;ldquo;You&amp;rsquo;re not right, Jeremy Crawford is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using GLOG as a base for your work doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you&amp;rsquo;re beholden to the will of Arnold K, Skerples, myself, or anyone else any more than writing a book means you&amp;rsquo;re beholden to the will of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Gutenberg&#34;&gt;Johannes Gutenberg&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;The GLOG is decentralized and open-source:&lt;/strong&gt; It &lt;em&gt;explicitly&lt;/em&gt; exists to be remixed, torn apart, mashed with other things, and put back together. It&amp;rsquo;s how the GLOG works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-its-easy-and-fun&#34;&gt;2) It&amp;rsquo;s easy and fun. &lt;a href=&#34;#2-its-easy-and-fun&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Easy:&lt;/strong&gt; By starting with a GLOG, most of the work is already done for you. &lt;strong&gt;Your GLOGhack may begin as just a copy of &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html&#34;&gt;Many Rats on Sticks&lt;/a&gt; and a google doc of house rules&lt;/strong&gt; like &amp;ldquo;ignore the page of rules for feudal estates, we&amp;rsquo;re doing high fantasy&amp;rdquo;, &lt;strong&gt;but it&amp;rsquo;s still &lt;em&gt;yours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fun:&lt;/strong&gt; Once you take that first terrifying leap of faith and start writing your own hack,I can guarantee you&amp;rsquo;ll find joy in it. But beyond that (and especially coming from 5e), you might discover a certain fun in the &amp;ldquo;OSR&amp;rdquo; style of play many GLOGhacks are built for. Arnold K wrote a short post about it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/05/advice-for-osr-dms.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; and Ben Laurence of Mazirian&amp;rsquo;s Garden wrote three posts on the strengths of the genre &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2019/04/pleasures-of-osr-secrecy-and-discovery.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2019/04/pleasures-of-osr-emergent-story-and.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://maziriansgarden.blogspot.com/2020/06/pleasures-of-osr-overcoming-challenges.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But even if you don&amp;rsquo;t find that style of play compelling&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-you-can-focus-on-the-game-and-genre-you-want-to-run&#34;&gt;3) You can focus on the game and genre you want to run. &lt;a href=&#34;#3-you-can-focus-on-the-game-and-genre-you-want-to-run&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benefit of having your own hack is that it can be a &lt;strong&gt;living document:&lt;/strong&gt; You don&amp;rsquo;t have to wait for a new edition or errata to fix something, and rather than waiting for a sourcebook to release for an alternate genre or switching systems entirely, you can easily adjust your system to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make character creation as long or as short as you want, character death as relevant or irrelevant as you want, combat as tactical or as abstracted as you want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can write the emotional or political themes you want in your campaign &lt;em&gt;right into the rules&lt;/em&gt; - your game can be explicitly anti-racist, explicitly socialist, explicitly queer, explicitly about the talking mice from Redwall, all in a way that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;backed up directly by the mechanics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, say you want to run a campaign about the golden age of piracy, swashbuckling adventure on the high seas: &lt;a href=&#34;https://thethingswedoforxp.blogspot.com/2019/10/piracy-glog-ruleset-jar-of-dirt.html&#34;&gt;Limit your classes to those that might be found aboard a ship, write some rules for firearms, cannon, sailing, and ship combat.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you want more tactical combat: &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;Add Attacks of Opportunity and an explicit action economy back in, and a complicated system of weapon tags.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you want a game as much about managing stress and the relationships between party members as it is about dungeon crawling: &lt;a href=&#34;https://oblidisideryptch.blogspot.com/2020/05/bones-glog-hack.html&#34;&gt;How about mental and metaphysical inventory systems?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, as the links above illustrate, there might already be a GLOGhack that does something close to what you&amp;rsquo;re looking for that you can steal from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;how-do-i-start&#34;&gt;How do I start? &lt;a href=&#34;#how-do-i-start&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;First, open a text file, maybe a Word document. Personally, I like Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go through a copy of the GLOG. I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html&#34;&gt;the final version of Skerples&amp;rsquo; GLOGhack, perhaps the closest thing to a canonical, orthodox GLOG compiled in one document&lt;/a&gt; - but there&amp;rsquo;s an index linked at the end of this post if you want to look for one that better suits your needs as a starting point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make some notes on stuff you like and stuff you don&amp;rsquo;t. Maybe add some notes about things you like and want to include that don&amp;rsquo;t appear in the rules you&amp;rsquo;re reading. If you think of some, &lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/game-design-when-to-write-rule.html&#34;&gt;write rules to include those things.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some other GLOGblins have taken up the banner and written essays on how they started to make their GLOGhacks. These may help:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take breaks! Go for a walk or make yourself a meal. This is your game, it is here for you, and it will be there for you when you get back. There&amp;rsquo;s no release schedule to keep up with, no ruling arguments to keep abreast of. It&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;yours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get some friends together and run a game. Keep your notes open - make more, on what worked and what didn&amp;rsquo;t, what you might want to change, and any rulings you make on the fly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read some more GLOGhacks. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;Start a blog.&lt;/a&gt; Post about your rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start formatting your house rules document into its own thing, so you have just one file to print out or send to your players. Keep playing games and making notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Come by the &lt;a href=&#34;https://discord.gg/RvCKZrE&#34;&gt;GLOG channel on Chris McDowall&amp;rsquo;s OSR discord&lt;/a&gt; and ask for help whenever or wherever you get stuck.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;further-reading&#34;&gt;Further Reading &lt;a href=&#34;#further-reading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An incomplete index of GLOGhacks, and a link to the sheet with all of them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/lair-of-lamb-final.html&#34;&gt;Lair of the Lamb&lt;/a&gt; by Arnold K., an introductory dungeon that contains the latest version of his GLOG - which differs dramatically from the original, and indeed from most hacks&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;The GLOG&lt;/a&gt; by Arnold K., the post that started it all&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://nuclearharuspex.blogspot.com/2019/10/nuclear-ooze.html&#34;&gt;Nuclear Ooze&lt;/a&gt; by Micah A., another very nicely formatted fairly traditional GLOG&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://twogoblinsinatrenchcoat.blogspot.com/2019/01/moonhop-oddhack.html&#34;&gt;Moonhop&lt;/a&gt; by Type1Ninja, a well-formatted hack that combines GLOG with Into the Odd&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2020/05/full-glog-hack-vain-sword.html&#34;&gt;Vain the Sword&lt;/a&gt; by Phlox, a well-formatted hack for bronze-age roleplaying in the author&amp;rsquo;s own setting &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;The GROG&lt;/a&gt; by Vayra (that&amp;rsquo;s me), my personal GLOGhack, aiming to be a complete system in only seven pages without compromising on tactical combat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;And a &amp;ldquo;Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&amp;rdquo; for it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of it is about orcs and how they&amp;rsquo;ve become a symbol for racism in fantasy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twtext.com/article/1254442473474199553&#34;&gt;Ajey Pandey makes a short, hard-hitting post about it.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of it is about WotC&amp;rsquo;s conduct as a company:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wizards, no sense of right and wrong&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This post isn&amp;rsquo;t about that,&lt;/strong&gt; but it is useful background information. Taken together, this has caused people to consider switching their tabletop rolegameplay game to other systems so as to distance themselves from Wizards of the Coast. I&amp;rsquo;m sure plenty of people will switch to Pathfinder, but while Paizo may be &amp;ldquo;a better corporation&amp;rdquo; they&amp;rsquo;re still a monolithic corporation, with all of the problems that that entails. Others might switch to Dungeon World, 13th Age, or Shadow of the Demon Lord - but again, you are leaving your gaming in the hands of designers who don&amp;rsquo;t know you or your players, and hoping that their vision will more or less suit you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to settle for &amp;ldquo;more-or-less&amp;rdquo;. &lt;strong&gt;My favorite tabletop roleplaying game - the GLOG - &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;rsquo;t even a game&lt;/em&gt;, it&amp;rsquo;s a toolkit for you to make the exact game you need and a community of DMs, GMs, and game designers who will help you do it.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; what this post is about.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain: Satans at the Crossroads</title>

      <pubDate>Wed, 24 Jun 2020 01:02:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hbEGMIj9tN4/XvLUaZLnTRI/AAAAAAAApdA/W3tbd_eIDo0p6SHk6hKI04dRQggjTpK-gCK4BGAsYHg/s607/satan.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-hbEGMIj9tN4/XvLUaZLnTRI/AAAAAAAApdA/W3tbd_eIDo0p6SHk6hKI04dRQggjTpK-gCK4BGAsYHg/s320/satan.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;i guess this means i have satans in my setting now, thanks &lt;a href=&#34;https://throneofsalt.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;dandyman&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Satans. You meet them at crossroads - sometimes by chance, sometimes by design. They have something to offer you. You have something they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can make a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;meeting-satan&#34;&gt;Meeting Satan &lt;a href=&#34;#meeting-satan&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;First of all, add &amp;lsquo;satan at the crossroads&amp;rsquo; to your encounter table, probably at one of the ends (snake eyes?). If you&amp;rsquo;re not at a crossroads and you roll it, roll again - satans only ever appear at crossroads. This is known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, every time you meet a satan after the first one, roll a die or flip a coin or something. This satan has a 50% chance of being a satan you&amp;rsquo;ve met before. (once you&amp;rsquo;ve met multiple satans, i guess do a second die roll to determine &lt;em&gt;which&lt;/em&gt; satan you&amp;rsquo;ve met before it is)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s a table for making satans. They generally appear as the same species as whoever is looking at them. Or maybe they don&amp;rsquo;t look like anything at all and you&amp;rsquo;re all just projecting. Who fuckin&amp;rsquo; knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;d6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skin&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bone-white&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two top hats&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigantic black-feathered wings&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jet black&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goatee&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Really nice suit, briefcase&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bright red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bare chest, goat legs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dark red&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Large, curling horns&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leathery wings, pointed tail&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electric blue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blank white mask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unmistakably demonic shadow&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of a black goat&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Red dress, ostentatious jewelry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dealing-with-the-devil&#34;&gt;Dealing with the Devil &lt;a href=&#34;#dealing-with-the-devil&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Okay, you&amp;rsquo;ve met a satan, now what? Well, you get to make a deal, of course. Pay a small price, get a minor boon, pay a heavy price, you know&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s totally fine for a paladin to make a deal with a satan, by the way. There are any number of ways they can, and should, rationalize it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-does-this-satan-want-and-what-can-it-give-me&#34;&gt;What Does This Satan Want and What Can It Give Me &lt;a href=&#34;#what-does-this-satan-want-and-what-can-it-give-me&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, a satan will have a particular price in mind for a particular boon. If you offer them something else, they&amp;rsquo;ll charge you double. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the below, any satan can offer you food/water/healing/rest/&amp;amp;c in exchange for any small price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;prices&#34;&gt;Prices &lt;a href=&#34;#prices&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Something you don&amp;rsquo;t want&lt;/strong&gt; - an injury, a curse, a disease, etc. But you gotta talk it up like you do want it, or they&amp;rsquo;ll catch on that it&amp;rsquo;s not actually valuable to you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some part of your body,&lt;/strong&gt; usually a finger or an eyeball. A greedy satan might start out asking for a whole arm and a leg (hence the saying), but you can probably talk them down to one or two digits if it&amp;rsquo;s for a lesser boon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your youth.&lt;/strong&gt; A percentage - the satan will probably start at 50% but can be talked down to just below 10 - of your remaining natural lifespan. You&amp;rsquo;re an adventurer, you weren&amp;rsquo;t planning to live that long anyway, right?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A share in your soul.&lt;/strong&gt; Agree to a length of time - the satan will probably start at five minutes, but haggling is expected - and the satan can possess your body &lt;em&gt;whenever they want, but only once,&lt;/em&gt; for that length of time or shorter. It is in the satan&amp;rsquo;s best interests to keep you alive during that time (how else are they going to persuade you to sell them the rest of your soul? unless you already sold it, in which case, paying this price is a really bad idea) but their goals probably don&amp;rsquo;t line up very well with yours otherwise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your soul.&lt;/strong&gt; You only have one of these, and if you sell it, you&amp;rsquo;re fucked once you die. No resurrection, no reanimation, no speak-with-dead, nothing can bring you back, even for a short time. High-level souls are worth more, as are especially holy or &amp;lsquo;good&amp;rsquo; ones.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your life.&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously, this is a pretty bad idea to sell if you&amp;rsquo;ve already sold your soul, or just in general unless you have a really good plan to come back to life.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you come up with something else, they might still take it. Who can really know the machinations of a satan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;boons&#34;&gt;Boons &lt;a href=&#34;#boons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Youth&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Health.&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re not gonna grow old, and probably won&amp;rsquo;t ever get sick. It probably doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to trade your youth for this one, satans are wise to that kinda trick.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Beauty.&lt;/strong&gt; You look great. Like, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; great. Supernaturally seductive. That kind of thing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; The satan will answer a question. They know a lot, but maybe not everything. If they can&amp;rsquo;t answer the question, you get your price back.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wealth.&lt;/strong&gt; Either the satan just gives you an extremely valuable object, like a fiddle made of solid gold, or the next time you find treasure you find an improbably huge amount, or similar.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fame.&lt;/strong&gt; Supernatural proficiency at some sort of mundane craft, like piano playing. You get a new &lt;strong&gt;skill,&lt;/strong&gt; and anyone that witnesses you performing it can&amp;rsquo;t help but talk about how amazing you are at it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Power.&lt;/strong&gt; Either a simple numerical bonus (+2 to a stat, +1 to attack, that kind of thing) or some sort of magical ability, like being able to talk to goats, crows, and &lt;em&gt;creatures of the night&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can every satan offer all of these things? Probably not. Can they offer other stuff? Sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gaming-the-system&#34;&gt;Gaming the System &lt;a href=&#34;#gaming-the-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you balk at the idea of giving up one of your eyes or whatever, you can always challenge the satan to a game of chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, set your stakes. This is basically the same as the normal negotiation for a boon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, suggest a game. The satan has veto power. &lt;a href=&#34;https://twogoblinsinatrenchcoat.blogspot.com/2019/09/reapers.html&#34;&gt;Rock-paper-scissors and Connect 4 are popular.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you win, you get the boon without paying a price. If you lose, you pay the price without getting the boon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain: A Tale Of Two Cities/It Takes An Adventuring Party To Raise A Village (GLOG City Challenge)</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/06/mountain-tale-of-two-citiesit-takes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 18 Jun 2020 16:39:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/06/mountain-tale-of-two-citiesit-takes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://oblidisideryptch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Oblidisideryptch&lt;/a&gt; over on the OSR Discord is running a City Challenge. The rules are &amp;ldquo;make an interesting city.&amp;rdquo;, and I&amp;rsquo;ve got two cities to flesh out, so I figured I&amp;rsquo;d throw my hat in the ring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;References to money are silver standard. Rules are &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;GROG.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cities-on-the-mountain&#34;&gt;Cities on the Mountain &lt;a href=&#34;#cities-on-the-mountain&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are two &amp;ldquo;Cities&amp;rdquo; on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain,&lt;/a&gt; though &amp;ldquo;City&amp;rdquo; is a bit of a misnomer at least initially as at the start of the campaign they will be little more than shanty towns. The concept is that the cities level up as the players do, growing in utility and population and serving as a method of permanent, shared advancement in the face of almost certain PC death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m going to pull heavily from &lt;a href=&#34;https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2020/01/it-takes-village-to-raise-adventuring.html&#34;&gt;this concept&lt;/a&gt; to run that, I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are also a number of small farming/fishing/hunting/logging communities that support the Cities, generally close by and relying on them for protection. These each have a population under a few hundred and maybe one or two notable structures and ought to be the sort of thing that can be dropped in where appropriate and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to detail them here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If PCs advance one City, the other one will advance randomly - maybe at a lower (half) rate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-new-city&#34;&gt;The New City &lt;a href=&#34;#the-new-city&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first is the New City, originally constructed by settlers (the first on the Mountain) from the goblinoid Charter Nations some 30-ish years ago in a gold-rush frenzied dream of colonial riches as the first explorers returned to the Civilized Lands with tales of a green and pleasant land ripe for exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second explorers, of course, didn&amp;rsquo;t return at all. As a result, the New City has receded bit by bit within its initial bounds to the point where it is now more of a shanty town, set up within the half-finished ruins of an over-ambitious frontier wonderland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s run more by the mafias and cartels of the Charter Nations than it is by anybody else, really. There&amp;rsquo;s very little &amp;lsquo;governmental&amp;rsquo; presence, beyond a few ships in the harbor and a weakly organized militia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/05/mountain-rat-warrens-dungeon.html&#34;&gt;Rat Warrens&lt;/a&gt; connect to the City via a network of underground tunnels, and the Crabman Caves and Goatman Village are nearby. Ratmen are hostile but more of an annoyance than a direct threat, crabmen are largely neutral, and goatmen have a complicated relationship with the City (some neutral, some hostile).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blacksmith and Bowyer (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Church (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tavern (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thieves&amp;rsquo; Guild (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walls (level 1, palisade)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing (population ~3000)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruins (easily repairable to house considerably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Species:&lt;/strong&gt; Majority goblinoid, some orc/moth elf, few kobold/lizardfolk/minotaur/gnoll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Class:&lt;/strong&gt; Majority settler, some explorer/adventurer/criminal/mercantile, few militia&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-old-city&#34;&gt;The Old City &lt;a href=&#34;#the-old-city&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second is the Old City, a series of low stone blockhouses and massive ziggurats constructed innumerable centuries before by whatever originally dwelt on the Mountain, but colonized more recently (well within the last decade) by the orcish River Kingdoms. A nest of tents and lean-tos cover the tops, hosting the beginnings of a heavily industrialized, painstakingly cautious, and rigidly controlled colonial/extractive effort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s much more well-organized than the New City, with most of the population belonging properly to one of the Kingdoms and working, more or less directly, for the colony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Barracks (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blacksmith (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Industry (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Market (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Towers (level 1, 2-story wooden towers atop ziggurats)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workshop (level 1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Housing (population ~1500)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ziggurats (easily furnished to house considerably &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Demographics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Species:&lt;/strong&gt; Majority orc, some goblinoid, few moth elf/lizardfolk/minotaur, no kobold/gnoll&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Class: **Majority worker, some military/settler, few explorer/adventurer/mercantile&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;city-structures&#34;&gt;City Structures &lt;a href=&#34;#city-structures&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can advance a structure 1 level (or construct a new structure at level 1) by selling a significant treasure or spending a great deal of money in town. Every time a structure advances, the population of the City will also increase, as more people are drawn to the Mountain by the riches you recover. Past a certain point, NPC adventurers will also start venturing into the Mountain. Some structures might require additional conditions to advance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A higher-level structure provides all of the lower-level services as well. When a structure mentions hirelings/special items/etc, reroll them whenever the party checks in at that location and have spent a few days or more outside of the City since the last time.&lt;/p&gt;

PCs can become FIGHTMASTERS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/strong&gt; - A large, well-equipped standing army is present. 1d3 higher-level FIGHTMASTERS and/or other martial characters are available for hire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 2,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 3, one level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 3, two level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blacksmith and Bowyer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Forges, stocks, and sells tools, can repair weapons and armor, might be able to custom-make some with time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Forges, stocks, and sells basic weapons and armor, might be able to custom-make more advanced stuff with time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/strong&gt; - Forges, stocks, and sells advanced weapons and armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4&lt;/strong&gt; - Requires a magic anvil looted from deep under the Mountain or similar. Forges, stocks, and sells 1d3 minor magic weapons and armor each time the party returns to the City:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 weapon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 weapon, 1 shield or armor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 weapon, 1 shield, 1 armor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Church/Cathedral&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Advancing a Church influences its religious sectarian alignment towards yours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1&lt;/strong&gt; - A handful of lay-clergy are present. Offers non-magical healing, sells indulgences, has minor influence over the populace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2&lt;/strong&gt; - A bishop is present, maybe as a punitive posting or to keep them out of the way. Produces and sells holy water. Has moderate influence over the populace.&lt;/p&gt;

Can perform significant miracles and White Magic. Has powerful influence over the populace. 1d3 higher-level paladins are available for hire:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 2,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 3, one level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 3, two level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Simple trade goods (ore, wood, plant matter, food, &amp;amp;c) are available in bulk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2&lt;/strong&gt; - More complex trade goods (worked metal, furniture, fabric, &amp;amp;c) are available in bulk. Produces, stocks, and sells minor vehicles (carts, wagons, barges, riverboats).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/strong&gt; - Any trade good is available in bulk. Produces, stocks, and sells major vehicles (ships). Can probably be retooled to produce anything else of significant scale if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Market&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Buys and sells a slim selection of basic gear/tools and food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Buys and sells more advanced gear/tools (lanterns, telescopes and navigation equipment, collapsible 10ft poles, really good backpacks, etc), food, and minor luxury goods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/strong&gt; - Buys and sells all luxury goods and art objects. Can probably find pretty much anything you need in here.&lt;/p&gt;

A small naval force is present. 1d3 higher-level sailors (&lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/08/osr-glog-pirates-megapost.html&#34;&gt;pick a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://thethingswedoforxp.blogspot.com/2019/10/piracy-glog-ruleset-jar-of-dirt.html&#34;&gt;thematic class&lt;/a&gt;) and mercenary warships are available to hire:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;One level 3, one level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One level 3, two level 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Workshop&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 1&lt;/strong&gt; - Crafts, stocks, and sells tools, can repair technological devices (crossbows, firearms, simple siege engines and vehicles). Might be able to custom-make a simple one with time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 2&lt;/strong&gt; - Crafts, stocks, and sells basic technological devices (simple crossbows, firearms, explosives, siege engines and vehicles), might be able to custom-make more advanced stuff with time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 3&lt;/strong&gt; - Crafts, stocks, and sells technological devices (crossbows, most firearms, advanced explosives, simple clockwork devices), can definitely custom-make more advanced stuff with time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Level 4&lt;/strong&gt; - Requires advanced scientific documents recovered from the Mountain.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;hirelings&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hirelings&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#hirelings&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You have two options for hirelings. Regardless of which one you use, hirelings have &lt;strong&gt;12 in one stat&lt;/strong&gt; related to their profession or species and &lt;strong&gt;10 in all others&lt;/strong&gt; or use their monster statline, if they have one. Doubling their wage adds 2 to their morale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option One: Consistent Hirelings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hirelings have &lt;strong&gt;4 + CON HP per HD,&lt;/strong&gt; have &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; equal to &lt;strong&gt;7 + hiring character&amp;rsquo;s CHA,&lt;/strong&gt; and demand a &lt;strong&gt;weekly wage&lt;/strong&gt; of  &lt;strong&gt;HD * 7 gp.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably a useful option if you&amp;rsquo;re hiring a whole bunch of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Option Two: Random Hirelings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hirelings roll each &lt;strong&gt;HD + CON&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;HP,&lt;/strong&gt; have &lt;strong&gt;morale&lt;/strong&gt; equal to &lt;strong&gt;2d6 + hiring character&amp;rsquo;s CHA,&lt;/strong&gt; and demand a &lt;strong&gt;weekly wage&lt;/strong&gt; of &lt;strong&gt;HD * morale gp, +/- up to 50%****.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is more fun. Makes it a gamble. Especially if you don&amp;rsquo;t tell your players the potential hireling&amp;rsquo;s HD.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLOG/Mountain: Fighters and Rogues</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 04 Jun 2020 18:30:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, we know ordinary PCs can&amp;rsquo;t be a Fighter or a Rogue on the Mountain, because all of those people are 1) less interesting than Paladins and Witches and 2) probably busy getting rich back in the Civilized Lands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if somebody really wants to play one? What if the party improves the economy and success of one of the Cities on the Mountain to the point where those people start to show up? What if you want an NPC that is good at fighting or stealing and isn&amp;rsquo;t a Paladin, Gutter Knight, or Witch (true or false)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, I guess that means I have to write a Fighter and Rogue class on a similar (high) power level to the other classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also wanted to try adding resource pools kind of like a Wizard&amp;rsquo;s MD to the other &amp;lsquo;core&amp;rsquo; classes. We&amp;rsquo;ll see how that went. I wanted Fighters to use Coins (Blood Money), but couldn&amp;rsquo;t figure out a way to do it good, so they have Violence Dice instead. So it goes, on the Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;gambler-class-rogue&#34;&gt;GAMBLER (Class: Rogue) &lt;a href=&#34;#gambler-class-rogue&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a Rogue. Not a Thief, that&amp;rsquo;s different. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bZE8siZjjRw/XtmIdsbgc_I/AAAAAAAApW4/GoU5nckPNF4xAE9vkBFoa45HQRi3SD2gwCK4BGAsYHg/s1280/poro-twisted-fate-guide-legends-of-runeterra.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-bZE8siZjjRw/XtmIdsbgc_I/AAAAAAAApW4/GoU5nckPNF4xAE9vkBFoa45HQRi3SD2gwCK4BGAsYHg/s320/poro-twisted-fate-guide-legends-of-runeterra.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;sort of like this, but a hobgoblin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ojyWQo8zEMc/XtmIi3en6cI/AAAAAAAApXE/rT66C0ZznNYGKsDMarvlLcM_9xHU_UaYwCK4BGAsYHg/s2000/c318b6efd1c1f41392da78e07fa0bbf2.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ojyWQo8zEMc/XtmIi3en6cI/AAAAAAAApXE/rT66C0ZznNYGKsDMarvlLcM_9xHU_UaYwCK4BGAsYHg/s320/c318b6efd1c1f41392da78e07fa0bbf2.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;or like this, but an orc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You will need:&lt;/strong&gt; A deck of standard playing cards. Take the &lt;strong&gt;jokers&lt;/strong&gt; out, but keep them around. &lt;strong&gt;Aces count as 1 or 11&lt;/strong&gt; depending on which is most advantageous to you, &lt;strong&gt;face cards count as 10.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have the opportunity to cheat, do it. If the GM catches you cheating, though&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;your ability has no effect&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you lose all the cards in your hand, &amp;ldquo;up your sleeve&amp;rdquo;, and they&amp;rsquo;re allowed to check under your character sheet and make you shake out your actual pockets and sleeves and take all those cards too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;you suffer a &lt;strong&gt;Complication&lt;/strong&gt; (if you&amp;rsquo;re cheating at Blackjack) or the effects of a &lt;strong&gt;critical miss&lt;/strong&gt; (if you&amp;rsquo;re cheating at Dirty Poker) immediately&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/A: Blackjack, Cat-Eyed, Rover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/B: Dirty Poker, Card Sharp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/C: Card Up Your Sleeve, Honor Among Thieves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4/D: Joker In The Pack, Stacking The Deck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Blackjack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you make a &lt;strong&gt;d20&lt;/strong&gt; roll to do thief stuff (climbing, squeezing, balancing, sneaking, conning, stealing, &lt;strong&gt;actually playing cards,&lt;/strong&gt; et cetera), you may pull a card. If it would be advantageous, you can use the card&amp;rsquo;s value in place of your roll. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to pull a card if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to (for example if you&amp;rsquo;ve got a high hand already and think failing the roll will be better for you than whatever your GM will pick as a &lt;strong&gt;Complication&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If drawing would put &lt;strong&gt;five or more&lt;/strong&gt; cards in your hand, you can subtract the card drawn from your roll (add, if using a roll-over system) instead of using it in the roll&amp;rsquo;s place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the card you draw brings you to exactly &lt;strong&gt;21,&lt;/strong&gt; you automatically succeed at this roll and lose all the cards in your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the cards in your hand total higher than &lt;strong&gt;21,&lt;/strong&gt; you&amp;rsquo;ve gone bust. You lose all cards in your hand (including the one drawn) and a &lt;strong&gt;Complication&lt;/strong&gt; occurs, decided by your GM. The normal effect (replacing/subtracting) still happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Potential Complications:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Knock something over or step on something, making noise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re slipping and need to leap (&amp;ldquo;dyno&amp;rdquo; in actual climbing parlance, apparently) to somewhere else &lt;em&gt;right now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve mentioned something you shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have and your mark is uncomfortable, if not necessarily onto your game.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t use this ability on attack rolls or combat maneuver checks - that&amp;rsquo;s what &lt;strong&gt;Dirty Poker&lt;/strong&gt; is for. You lose all the cards in your &lt;strong&gt;Blackjack&lt;/strong&gt; hand when you enter combat or the scene ends. If you start doing thief stuff while in combat, keep your &lt;strong&gt;Blackjack&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Dirty Poker&lt;/strong&gt; hands separate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Cat-Eyed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You suffer no penalties from acting in dim light. You still take normal penalties from total or near-total darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Rover&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re well-traveled, and have a storied past. You get &lt;strong&gt;2 additional Skills/Backgrounds.&lt;/strong&gt; However, you also have only &lt;strong&gt;6 + STR HP&lt;/strong&gt; at first level and gain only &lt;strong&gt;1d6 + STR&lt;/strong&gt; at each level thereafter on account of your generally poor health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Dirty Poker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you make a successful attack roll or combat maneuver check, draw a card. You can hold up to five cards in your hand at once - if you draw an additional card while you have five in your hand, you can choose to replace a card in your hand with the card you drew, or discard it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play poker hands to perform a &lt;strong&gt;Finishing Move.&lt;/strong&gt; Doing so empties your hand. Performing a &lt;strong&gt;Finishing Move&lt;/strong&gt; doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an action, and can target anyone within your &lt;strong&gt;reach&lt;/strong&gt; or about &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt; if you have a ranged weapon or something to throw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t have to show anyone the faces of the cards in your hand (even the GM) until you play them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finishing Moves:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Expose&lt;/strong&gt; - Apply a number of notches to your opponent&amp;rsquo;s armor equal to the value of the card you have a pair of (e.g. a pair of &lt;strong&gt;5s&lt;/strong&gt; applies &lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt; notches).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Two Pair&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Mutilate&lt;/strong&gt; - Deal damage to one target equal to the value of the highest card you have a pair of, and a second target equal to the value of the lowest card you have a pair of.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Three Of A Kind&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Exsanguinate&lt;/strong&gt; - Deal damage to one target equal to the value of the card you have three of. If they have a circulatory system, they bleed for that much damage at the start of your turn until they spend an action staunching the flow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight or Flush&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Eviscerate&lt;/strong&gt; - Deal &lt;strong&gt;11&lt;/strong&gt; damage to one target. They roll &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; or die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight Flush&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;strong&gt;Execute&lt;/strong&gt; - Kill a target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Card Sharp&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When attacking a surprised enemy or flanking, you can use the value of the card you pull for &lt;strong&gt;Dirty Poker&lt;/strong&gt; instead of rolling damage for your weapon. You have to decide to do this before rolling damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Card Up Your Sleeve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you draw a card, you can hold it face-down on the table instead of putting it into your hand. If you have a card held this way, when you draw another card you can choose which one of them goes into your hand and which one stays &amp;ldquo;up your sleeve&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You lose the &lt;strong&gt;card up your sleeve&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you take a long rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Honor Among Thieves&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever anyone in your party and present in the scene scores a critical success, you can draw a card or discard one from your hand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Joker In The Pack&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shuffle the &lt;strong&gt;jokers&lt;/strong&gt; back into your deck of cards. They&amp;rsquo;re wild - they count as whatever card you want them to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Stacking The Deck&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your critical success range doubles (i.e. you now score critical successes on rolls of &lt;strong&gt;19 or 20,&lt;/strong&gt; not just &lt;strong&gt;20&lt;/strong&gt;). Whenever you score a critical success and would draw a card, draw two instead and pick one to keep and one to discard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;fightmaster-class-fighter&#34;&gt;FIGHTMASTER (Class: Fighter) &lt;a href=&#34;#fightmaster-class-fighter&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;Fighter.&lt;/strong&gt; Not a &lt;strong&gt;Knight,&lt;/strong&gt; not a &lt;strong&gt;Soldier,&lt;/strong&gt; but one who has above all else dedicated themselves to mastering the &lt;strong&gt;Fight.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N7KcQ4ghQW8/XtmMasFNibI/AAAAAAAApXo/cLzOUp6bRt4we0jxTMyIhmPcvl8Md3F-QCK4BGAsYHg/s500/2561.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N7KcQ4ghQW8/XtmMasFNibI/AAAAAAAApXo/cLzOUp6bRt4we0jxTMyIhmPcvl8Md3F-QCK4BGAsYHg/s320/2561.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;like this&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;a Blademaster from Warcraft would have also worked here but probably not shirtless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PlWMm4dwyJg/XtmMhMax9kI/AAAAAAAApX0/e3OO6-_mzHAI19adAxnisSny8_YJBYrggCK4BGAsYHg/s1813/tumblr_p9i57clU0T1ud46s0o1_1280.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PlWMm4dwyJg/XtmMhMax9kI/AAAAAAAApX0/e3OO6-_mzHAI19adAxnisSny8_YJBYrggCK4BGAsYHg/s320/tumblr_p9i57clU0T1ud46s0o1_1280.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;or &lt;a href=&#34;https://earltheartist.tumblr.com/post/174376356538/misterbadguy159-commissioned-me-to-make-a-dnd&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; but with less magic and more sideburns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1/A: Person of Violence, Training, +1 School, +1 Technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2/B: Guard Ally, Embarrass, +1 Technique&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3/C: Steel Tide, Swordwife, +1 School, +2 Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4/D: Posse Comitatus, Weapon Mastery, +2 Techniques&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Person of Violence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a pool of &lt;strong&gt;Violence Dice&lt;/strong&gt; equal to your level. A &lt;strong&gt;Violence Die&lt;/strong&gt; is the same die you roll for weapon damage. If you&amp;rsquo;re holding multiple weapons, you can pick which die you use as your &lt;strong&gt;Violence Die.&lt;/strong&gt; If a weapon does multiple dice of damage, its damage die is one of those dice, not all of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can roll and expend a Violence Die to do one of the following:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Perform a free &lt;strong&gt;combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; to an &lt;strong&gt;attack roll.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When you are hit by an attack, make an &lt;strong&gt;attack roll.&lt;/strong&gt; Subtract &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; from the damage you take if you succeed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you roll a &lt;strong&gt;Violence Die&lt;/strong&gt; in connection with an &lt;strong&gt;attack roll&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;check,&lt;/strong&gt; you also deal &lt;strong&gt;[sum]&lt;/strong&gt; damage to any target within a reasonable distance that your &lt;strong&gt;attack roll&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;combat maneuver check&lt;/strong&gt; would have succeeded against. You have to narrate how you&amp;rsquo;re doing this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You regain all &lt;strong&gt;Violence Dice&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you roll initiative or take a long rest, or one &lt;strong&gt;Violence Die&lt;/strong&gt; whenever you roll maximum damage on an attack. When you regain a &lt;strong&gt;Violence Die&lt;/strong&gt; as a result of rolling maximum damage, it is the same die size as you rolled maximum damage on. You can never have more &lt;strong&gt;Violence Dice&lt;/strong&gt; in your pool than your level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Training&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lifetime of martial training and athleticism allows you to shrug off blows that would fell a lesser person, and strike true more often in combat. You get &lt;strong&gt;2 additional HP at every Fightmaster level including first, and +1 to Attack at first level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Guard Ally&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You serve as a guardian for your allies in combat, steering the Fight into yourself just as surely you steer yourself into it. &lt;strong&gt;Once per round,&lt;/strong&gt; you can cause an enemy melee attack made against an adjacent ally to target you instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Embarrass&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you successfully strike a target, you can forgo dealing damage in order to make said target roll &lt;strong&gt;Charisma,&lt;/strong&gt; opposed by the damage you would have dealt if they&amp;rsquo;re of equal or lower **HD **than you. If they fail, they back down (treat as a failed &lt;strong&gt;Morale&lt;/strong&gt; check in combat). Narrate what you did to them - maybe you carved a Zorro-like symbol into their chest, or cut their belt so their pants fall down like they&amp;rsquo;re the defendant in some sort of Stalinesque show trial. Regardless, your martial superiority is evident. This is perfectly legal in most places on the Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Steel Tide&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weapons become (figuratively) weightless in your hands, allowing you to overwhelm your enemies with a ceaseless flurry of blows. You can make &lt;strong&gt;one additional attack per round&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;no additional difficulty for making multiple attacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Swordwife&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pick a specific weapon - &amp;ldquo;this sword&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;that rifle&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;swords&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;rifles&amp;rdquo;. When wielding that weapon, &lt;strong&gt;count your Attack as 1 higher,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;deal 1 additional damage.&lt;/strong&gt; You can wield it as if it were a &lt;strong&gt;light, medium or heavy weapon,&lt;/strong&gt; and throw it with a range of &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo; per level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reassign your chosen weapon by practicing with the new weapon for &lt;strong&gt;1 week&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;using it to slay a sapient creature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Posse Comitatus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You acquire a column of &lt;strong&gt;2d6 students, squires, and camp followers.&lt;/strong&gt; The lower die are &lt;strong&gt;camp followers,&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;useful skills or backgrounds, improvised weapons,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;light armor.&lt;/strong&gt; The higher die are &lt;strong&gt;students or squires,&lt;/strong&gt; with &lt;strong&gt;useless skills or backgrounds, military swords,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;medium armor.&lt;/strong&gt; Treat these as &lt;strong&gt;hirelings&lt;/strong&gt; that don&amp;rsquo;t count towards your &lt;strong&gt;hireling limit.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Students and squires&lt;/strong&gt; are willing to stand in combat with you, and all will follow your orders within reason. You must spend at least &lt;strong&gt;8 hours per week&lt;/strong&gt; teaching your &lt;strong&gt;students and squires,&lt;/strong&gt; but don&amp;rsquo;t have to pay them. &lt;strong&gt;Camp followers&lt;/strong&gt; demand pay of &lt;strong&gt;1 gp or 10 sp per day.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lost &lt;strong&gt;students, squires, or camp followers&lt;/strong&gt; can be replaced in any settlement of reasonable size with &lt;strong&gt;one day of effort each.&lt;/strong&gt; Losing too many may result in you getting a &lt;strong&gt;bad reputation&lt;/strong&gt; and your followers suffering &lt;strong&gt;Morale penalties&lt;/strong&gt; or taking longer to replace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Weapon Mystery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Choose a &lt;strong&gt;mystery.&lt;/strong&gt; You gain the associated bonus and &lt;strong&gt;never critically fail an attack roll&lt;/strong&gt; with weapons of the associated type.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can reassign your chosen **mystery **by practicing with a weapon of the new type for &lt;strong&gt;1 week&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;using it to slay a sapient creature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Weapon Mysteries:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blunt or Crushing&lt;/strong&gt; - Ignore **AC.**When you deal maximum damage or critically hit, your opponent is &lt;strong&gt;stunned&lt;/strong&gt; for one round.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bow, Crossbow, or Firearm -&lt;/strong&gt; Automatically hit vs. inanimate targets within &lt;strong&gt;range.&lt;/strong&gt; Your attacks pierce targets - whenever you score a hit, you can make a &lt;strong&gt;free attack&lt;/strong&gt; with the same weapon against something behind your target without using additional ammunition.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Throatcutter or Close Quarter **- Automatically &lt;strong&gt;critically hit&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt; targets and deal damage each round in a **grapple **in addition to whatever **grapple **action you take.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brace &lt;strong&gt;- You have&lt;/strong&gt;+5&amp;rsquo; reach.&lt;/strong&gt; You and all adjacent allies get &lt;strong&gt;+1 AC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chain&lt;/strong&gt; - You have** +5&amp;rsquo; reach.**When you deal maximum damage or critically hit, your opponent is knocked &lt;strong&gt;prone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headsplitter or heavy melee weapon&lt;/strong&gt; - You cleave through opponents in great, sweeping blows - whenever you score a hit, make a &lt;strong&gt;free attack&lt;/strong&gt; against an adjacent enemy that you have not attacked yet this turn. Keep making &lt;strong&gt;free attacks&lt;/strong&gt; until you run out of targets or miss.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;**Finesse **- Add &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;strong&gt;damage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;AC.&lt;/strong&gt; Treat all &lt;strong&gt;non-warblade finesse weapons&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;warblades.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warblade&lt;/strong&gt; - Count your &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; higher. You can throw your weapon with a range of &lt;strong&gt;10&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;schools-and-techniques&#34;&gt;Schools and Techniques &lt;a href=&#34;#schools-and-techniques&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You learn &lt;strong&gt;techniques&lt;/strong&gt; by learning them from a teacher over the course of a month of training, or leveling up as a &lt;strong&gt;FIGHTMASTER.&lt;/strong&gt; Teachers will usually charge you &lt;strong&gt;3,000 sp&lt;/strong&gt; per &lt;strong&gt;technique&lt;/strong&gt; taught, but might very well charge more or require you to complete some sort of task first to prove your worthiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A &lt;strong&gt;school&lt;/strong&gt; is a grouping of &lt;strong&gt;techniques,&lt;/strong&gt; like &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;Manus&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; or **&amp;ldquo;Sacerd&amp;rdquo;. **When a **FIGHTMASTER **levels up and learns new &lt;strong&gt;techniques,&lt;/strong&gt; they can only pick ones from &lt;strong&gt;schools&lt;/strong&gt; they already know. A **FIGHTMASTER **automatically learns a new &lt;strong&gt;school&lt;/strong&gt; at levels **1 **and **3. **Learning a &lt;strong&gt;technique&lt;/strong&gt; from a teacher means you know that &lt;strong&gt;school&lt;/strong&gt; now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyone who isn&amp;rsquo;t a &lt;strong&gt;FIGHTMASTER&lt;/strong&gt; can know a number of &lt;strong&gt;techniques&lt;/strong&gt; equal to their level. &lt;strong&gt;FIGHTMASTERs&lt;/strong&gt; can know a number of **techniques **equal to **double **their **FIGHTMASTER **level. If you learn a &lt;strong&gt;technique&lt;/strong&gt; beyond your limit, you can replace an existing &lt;strong&gt;technique&lt;/strong&gt; with the new one. &lt;strong&gt;Techniques&lt;/strong&gt; don&amp;rsquo;t have to be learned in order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Techniques **can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2019/11/ten-of-swords-class-fighter-again.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-fight-book-techniques-for-fighters.html&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;OSR discord user Corgifan2 later clarified that this was due to the GM&amp;rsquo;s misunderstanding of a rule and they should only have made &lt;strong&gt;21&lt;/strong&gt; attacks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so, someone posted this in the OSR discord and i was &lt;em&gt;incensed&lt;/em&gt; to find the mass effect d20hack i &lt;em&gt;remember&lt;/em&gt; having written, because there&amp;rsquo;s no way it could be as bad as &lt;em&gt;apparently, the one that was officially released&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;well, i did find it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is from 2012&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is &lt;em&gt;real bad&lt;/em&gt; but it actually might be better than the system described above&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;so i am thus compelled to post it, in an effort to erase any respect and/or community goodwill i might have accrued thus far&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it lives in several google docs (because that is how i did things at the time &lt;strong&gt;how i still do things, tbh&lt;/strong&gt;) and it is written in the extremely tedious format of a child (i guess a 20 year old?) trying to emulate the extremely specific rules text of D&amp;amp;D 3.5e and also Magic the Gathering (because that is how i did things at the time. i think i have actually stopped doing this, mostly,. hopefully, thankfully)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i think the word &amp;ldquo;may&amp;rdquo; appears 33,000 times in total across t hese documents&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;okay-enough-self-deprecation-sorry-heres-the-game&#34;&gt;okay enough self-deprecation ,sorry &lt;strong&gt;HERE&amp;rsquo;S THE GAME&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#okay-enough-self-deprecation-sorry-heres-the-game&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;it is probably runnable, it looks fairly complete for what it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i do not recommend anyone do this, but who knows&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you have played the &amp;ldquo;official&amp;rdquo; mass effect d20 game please let me know if it&amp;rsquo;s better or worse, lmao&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In an effort to codify more of &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Mountain at the End of the World&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rsquo;s setting&lt;/a&gt; and hopefully end up with something that can actually be played, I drew a rough point-map (forgive my preschool-grade block printing)&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/4aAuZC8.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-P0uIC_ao1u4/Xsc1DCLu8WI/AAAAAAAApR4/GwtFCfWUfg8p12NrhMpjtOveZp6mjPQcwCK4BGAsYHg/w400-h288/themountain.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;clicc for big&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;hellip;and as a result, I was able to start working on the dungeon levels. That meant trying to write a one-page dungeon, realizing I was broadly incapable and blowing it up to 3 pages, settling on a layout, fumbling around trying to place stuff in various programs before deciding I&amp;rsquo;d just do it in photoshop, and, well, finally producing&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y287VjtbYqCNITL3RVib6CN8BoCoAQQl/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;The Rat Warrens.&lt;/a&gt; This is the &amp;ldquo;western&amp;rdquo; rat warrens on the map, under the New City, and is an &amp;ldquo;introductory&amp;rdquo; level to the megadungeon that is the Mountain. I&amp;rsquo;m not going to pretend it&amp;rsquo;s another Tomb of the Serpent Kings, but I think it does an okay job of teaching some basic dungeoncrawling lessons - carry lots of light, talk to everything, combat has consequences, it&amp;rsquo;s okay to run from fights, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be played with &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;the GROG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;The Mountain at the End of the World Player&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;, but (like any OSR-y D&amp;amp;D-y thing) it can be adjusted with fairly little effort to pretty much any other system that you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with. Of note I guess is that it doesn&amp;rsquo;t include morale stats (I just use a Charisma roll) so maybe have morale be 7 +/- CHA mod (which gives ratmen 5 morale and feels appropriate) or assign it by fiat or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adjusting it for a different setting is also pretty simple:&lt;br&gt;
hobgoblins = humans i guess, maybe elves or dwarves or what have you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ratmen, bat men = goblins, kobolds, or just leave them as-is&lt;br&gt;
elves (rooms 10-15 are ancient elf tombs but the assumption is none of the PCs know what the fuck is an elf, in case that wasn&amp;rsquo;t clear) = ancient evil snake people or some other sinister long-dead empire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This dungeon is free (of course), but if anyone ends up playing it, I would certainly appreciate some feedback&amp;ndash;or if you really enjoy it, a couple bucks thrown in my &lt;a href=&#34;https://ko-fi.com/vayraa&#34;&gt;ko-fi.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy with &amp;amp; proud of the Rat Warrens, and I hope to produce the rest of the Mountain levels in more or less this format over time. Let me know what you think!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>NO LIGHT NO WARMTH: Giant Spider II: Eightlegged Boogaloo</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/05/no-light-no-warmth-giant-spider-ii.html</link>

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/05/no-light-no-warmth-giant-spider-ii.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somewhere towards the &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/the-unfinished-world-glog-campaign.html&#34;&gt;southern edge of the tetrahedral world&lt;/a&gt;, an expedition gathers&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;em&gt;This is for &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s edge-climb campaign thingy, not &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;GROG&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
_&lt;br&gt;
The original flavor &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/gd-can-make-mistakes-glog-class-giant.html&#34;&gt;GIANT SPIDER AAAAAA&lt;/a&gt; is cool, but it&amp;rsquo;s a little weird for actual play probably. This started out as an attempt to &amp;ldquo;balance&amp;rdquo; it, but giant spiders are&amp;hellip; resistant to balancing. They just have Too Many Legs._&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;giant-spider-class-fighter-specialist&#34;&gt;Giant Spider (Class: &amp;hellip;Fighter? Specialist?) &lt;a href=&#34;#giant-spider-class-fighter-specialist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;You are a giant spider, about the size of a large dog, bigger than a human if you include all your legs but rather smaller than one if you don&amp;rsquo;t. You &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t wear armor or clothing or use tools&lt;/strong&gt; unless they were designed for giant spiders, &lt;strong&gt;can&amp;rsquo;t talk&lt;/strong&gt; (but you can dance expressively to get simple points across), and &lt;strong&gt;don&amp;rsquo;t have an inventory besides your spider backpack and spider harness.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Ballooning 2. Architecture 3. Craft Brewing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Spider backpack, spider harness, between 2 and 10 eyes, one other piece of &lt;strong&gt;spider gear&lt;/strong&gt; (see below).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**A: Chelicerae, ****Spinneret, ****Ambush Predator, **&lt;strong&gt;Too Many Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: +2 Adaptations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: +2 Adaptations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: +1 Adaptation, Choose 1 Adaptation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Chelicerae&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got fucking terrifying spider fangs. They have little claws on the end that you can use to pick stuff up and perform delicate manipulation, but not enough range of motion to use tools. They are a **medium **weapon that deal &lt;strong&gt;1d8 damage.&lt;/strong&gt; When you reduce something to &lt;strong&gt;0 or lower HP&lt;/strong&gt; with your **chelicerae **you can decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;dead&lt;/strong&gt; or just &lt;strong&gt;paralyzed for a while.&lt;/strong&gt; If it matters, your damage is dealt mostly through &lt;strong&gt;venom&lt;/strong&gt; and doesn&amp;rsquo;t really fuck up bodies visibly unless you look at their insides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Spinneret&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can produce shitty little cobwebs. You can use it like a sort of glue or binding, but not like a rope&amp;hellip; yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Ambush Predator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of sleeping, you lower your metabolic rate to a state that approximates sleep but during which you are still aware of your surroundings and from which you can wake instantly. While in this state, you don&amp;rsquo;t require food. If you do this for eight-ish hours, you require only &lt;strong&gt;half rations&lt;/strong&gt; that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Too Many Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve got eight of them. You can &lt;strong&gt;climb&lt;/strong&gt; (without rolling) anything a normal-size spider could, at your normal movement speed. You can &lt;strong&gt;climb&lt;/strong&gt; (with a roll) anything else like a &lt;strong&gt;monkey.&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t climb &lt;strong&gt;icy&lt;/strong&gt; things unless you&amp;rsquo;ve got little &lt;strong&gt;spider boots&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;spider gloves&lt;/strong&gt; or your feet will get cold and you&amp;rsquo;ll die. You can identify which category climbable things fall under by looking at them. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT THOSE LONG HAIRY LEGS ARE A LITTLE SEXY ACTUALLY 😳&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;adaptations&#34;&gt;Adaptations &lt;a href=&#34;#adaptations&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every time you gain an Adaptation, roll on this table. Each entry will specify if it stacks or if you need to reroll if you already have it or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mimicry.&lt;/strong&gt; You can disguise yourself as anything else of approximately large-dog-to-human-size. Observers will believe you are that thing as long as they didn&amp;rsquo;t see you start mimicking it. They get to roll &lt;strong&gt;SKLL&lt;/strong&gt; to see through the mimicry every time they are presented with evidence you are not that thing (for example, if you move and the thing you&amp;rsquo;re mimicking doesn&amp;rsquo;t normally move like a giant spider). &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a second time,&lt;/strong&gt; you can create puppet out of cobwebs and debris that approximates the form and movement of any creature that you could mimic. You can move the puppet much more realistically like a non-giant-spider than you can move yourself; observers only get to roll &lt;strong&gt;SKLL&lt;/strong&gt; to recognize it as a puppet if there&amp;rsquo;s enough light for them to examine it closely or see your puppet-strings. &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a third time,&lt;/strong&gt; reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Venom.&lt;/strong&gt; Your &lt;strong&gt;chelicerae&lt;/strong&gt; deal damage as a **heavy **weapon and can harm ghosts and the undead. &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a second time,&lt;/strong&gt; theydeal &lt;strong&gt;2d8 damage&lt;/strong&gt; and someone else can spend an hour (during which neither you nor they can do anything else) to extract one dose of venom from them. Extracted venom can be applied to a weapon to increase its damage die size by one for the first successful attack made with it, and lasts one day before losing potency. &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a third time,&lt;/strong&gt; reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Web.&lt;/strong&gt; You can produce super-strong spider webbing at a rate of about 10 feet per combat round (100 feet per minute). You decide whether it&amp;rsquo;s sticky or not each time you start producing webbing. You can&amp;rsquo;t get stuck in your own web, and whenever something else touches it you are instantly aware of it as long as you&amp;rsquo;re also touching that web. **If you get this adaptation a second time, **your sticky webbing can catch things like spells, ghosts, light, and abstract social constructs. **If you get this adaptation a third time, **reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Sense.&lt;/strong&gt; You get &lt;strong&gt;+2 INIT&lt;/strong&gt; and are aware of anything that moves within 30&amp;rsquo; of you and is in contact with at least one surface that you are also in contact with. **If you get this adaptation a second time, **you get another &lt;strong&gt;+2 INIT,&lt;/strong&gt; the radius of your &lt;strong&gt;spider sense&lt;/strong&gt; increases to 60&amp;rsquo;, and when you are &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt; you (the player) can say &lt;strong&gt;&amp;ldquo;my spider senses are tingling&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong&gt; to instead &lt;strong&gt;surprise&lt;/strong&gt; whatever **surprised **you. &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a third time,&lt;/strong&gt; reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Too Many Eyes.&lt;/strong&gt; You can see in dim light as well as normal people can in daylight. Light sources count as producing twice the radius of light for you. **If you get this adaptation a second time, **reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chitin.&lt;/strong&gt; You get &lt;strong&gt;+2 AC,&lt;/strong&gt; and look bigger and more intimidating. &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a second or third time,&lt;/strong&gt; you get another &lt;strong&gt;+2 AC.&lt;/strong&gt; **If you get this adaptation a fourth time, **reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bristles.&lt;/strong&gt; You grow thick ruffs of spider-fur and count as having appropriate clothing for any environment. If combined with actual spider-clothing for that environment, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to worry about its effects _at all. _**If you get this adaptation a second time, **your spider-fur grows thick, barbed bristles that deal &lt;strong&gt;1d8 damage&lt;/strong&gt; to anything that hits you with an unarmed attack or natural weapon, and you can lose their benefit for the rest of the day to fire them at anything within 10&amp;rsquo; as a ranged attack to deal &lt;strong&gt;1d8 damage&lt;/strong&gt; and give them &lt;strong&gt;-2 to all rolls&lt;/strong&gt; until they spend a minute picking bristles out of their eyes/face/hands/etc. &lt;strong&gt;If you get this adaptation a third time,&lt;/strong&gt; reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Powerful Legs.&lt;/strong&gt; Choose one. **If you get this adaptation a second time, **choose the other one. **If you get this adaptation a third time, **reroll it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get &lt;strong&gt;+2 MOVE&lt;/strong&gt; and can jump 20&amp;rsquo; vertically or 40&amp;rsquo; horizontally once per round without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action.&lt;/strong&gt; If you land next to (or on top of) something, it rolls &lt;strong&gt;morale.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You get &lt;strong&gt;+2 MOVE&lt;/strong&gt; and your movement speed increases to 60&amp;rsquo;. If you charge right at something and end up next to (or on top of) it, it rolls &lt;strong&gt;morale.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;spider-gear&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Gear&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#spider-gear&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Backpack.&lt;/strong&gt; Holds 6 slots of gear, counts as normal/slow inventory, can be accessed by spider legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Harness.&lt;/strong&gt; Holds 3 slots of gear, counts as fast inventory, can be accessed by spider legs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Saddle.&lt;/strong&gt; Lets you carry someone around while climbing, without having to bundle them up in a web cocoon and maybe eat them later. 2 slots since it gets in the way of your spider backpack. Carrying a person takes up 6 slots, which is generous tbh. You have to have enough slots for all of their gear as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Bow&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;8 Spider Arrows.&lt;/strong&gt; Held with your front two legs, drawn with your chelicerae. You can&amp;rsquo;t move in the same turn as you fire it. Otherwise like a longbow, but can&amp;rsquo;t be used by a non-spider. 2 slots for the bow, 1 slot for all the arrows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Steel Leg Sheaths. **Two of them, for your front-most legs. Count as &lt;strong&gt;medium&lt;/strong&gt; weapons and &lt;strong&gt;crowbars.&lt;/strong&gt; You &lt;strong&gt;climb&lt;/strong&gt; at half speed while wearing them. 1 slot each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Small Cocooned Monkey.&lt;/strong&gt; Very scared, not fond of you. Counts as three rations if you eat it. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cage of Live Squirrels.&lt;/strong&gt; Also very scared, also not fond of you. Has three squirrels in it, can probably fit about six if you really pack them in there. Each squirrel counts as a ration if you eat them. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Businesswear.&lt;/strong&gt; Designed for spiders, woven from normal silk (not spider silk!), very high quality. &lt;strong&gt;+1 Reaction&lt;/strong&gt; when wearing it and worth &lt;strong&gt;88 gp.&lt;/strong&gt; 2 slots if carried, no slots if worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pair of Spider Manacles.&lt;/strong&gt; Each an eight-foot length of chain with four cuffs on it. 1 slot each, 2 slots in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bird-Killer Injection.&lt;/strong&gt; Created by spider alchemists, difficult to administer to yourself without help. Deals &lt;strong&gt;1d8&lt;/strong&gt; damage to you and causes your &lt;strong&gt;chelicerae&lt;/strong&gt; to secrete a substance that dissolves calcium (bone, shell, chitin, etc) for one hour. Normal bones and such take about an hour to completely dissolve, fragile structures like hollow bird bones and insect wings dissolve instantly. While active, your &lt;strong&gt;chelicerae&lt;/strong&gt; damage is increased by one die size, and things with hollow bones roll &lt;strong&gt;DC 18 HRTS&lt;/strong&gt; when struck or have their bones dissolve. 3 doses, 1/3 of a slot each, 1 slot in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Boots.&lt;/strong&gt; Protects your feet from cold things, sharp things, acid, et cetera. &lt;strong&gt;Climb&lt;/strong&gt; at half speed while wearing them, but lets you climb on ice as if it were stone (you can&amp;rsquo;t do this normally). 2 slots in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Gloves.&lt;/strong&gt; Exactly identical to the above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Armor.&lt;/strong&gt; Metal plates riveted to your chitin. &lt;strong&gt;AC as Leather,&lt;/strong&gt; 2 slots since it gets in the way of your spider backpack, can&amp;rsquo;t be removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Spider Mask. **A cunning device that exactly resembles a human face, made out of only spider silk, wooden reinforcements, and a latex mask of a human face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Passport.&lt;/strong&gt; Required for entry into the fabled Spider Kingdom. Will produce respect if shown to other giant spiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Lantern.&lt;/strong&gt; Constructed in such a way that, when thrown, it bursts into flaming strands which cling to objects and creatures within 10&amp;rsquo; and deal &lt;strong&gt;1d8 fire damage&lt;/strong&gt; until extinguished or scraped off. Casts light as a lantern, 1 slot, can be affixed to your spider harness for &lt;strong&gt;chelicerae&lt;/strong&gt;-free operation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spider Furs.&lt;/strong&gt; Black and white, very intimidating. Appropriate clothing for giant spiders in cold weather. 3 slots if carried, 1 slot if worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Spider Switchblades. **Imagine some awful combination of hypodermic syringe and dental reconstruction device. Unfolds from your **chelicerae **to give you &lt;strong&gt;reach&lt;/strong&gt; on your bite attacks, but you can&amp;rsquo;t use them to manipulate objects. 2 slots if carried, no slots if worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Extra Leg.&lt;/strong&gt; Steel, with spider silk &amp;ldquo;tendons&amp;rdquo; pulled by your &lt;strong&gt;chelicerae,&lt;/strong&gt; which you can&amp;rsquo;t use to bite or manipulate objects while doing so. Acts like a single &lt;strong&gt;leg sheath&lt;/strong&gt; if attached near the front of your carapace, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t slow your &lt;strong&gt;climbing.&lt;/strong&gt; 2 slots if carried, no slots if worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A mysterious spider artifact. Roll on the following table:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KILL SPIDER AAAH,&lt;/strong&gt; an ancient &lt;strong&gt;heavy&lt;/strong&gt; sword of &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/twenty-three-swords-ish.html&#34;&gt;Chardun and Adamant.&lt;/a&gt; Single-edged blade, scrawled with ancient runes. He likes music and screams in terror when he sees a spider. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Razor Web Grenade.&lt;/strong&gt; Eight pins, each taking an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt; to pull (yes you can hold it out and have other people pull them too). Throwable, deals Xd8 damage to everything within X * 5&amp;rsquo; with a &lt;strong&gt;DC 8 MOVE&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half, where X is the number of pins you bothered to pull before throwing it. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Eight Spiky Iron Spiders.&lt;/strong&gt; Attach these to your own ass and turn your silk into a &lt;strong&gt;dire flail.&lt;/strong&gt; 1 slot if carried, no slots if worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Shadow Spider Amulet.&lt;/strong&gt; Allows the holder to walk into any shadow and emerge from any other shadow within line of sight. Each time it is used, has an X-in-8 chance of trapping the holder inside of itself and crumbling to dust, where X is the number of times it&amp;rsquo;s been used already. Made of starmetal, set with black gemstones, worth &lt;strong&gt;888 gp.&lt;/strong&gt; 1 slot if carried, no slots if worn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Bestiary: D is for Dragons</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-d-is-for-dragons.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 28 Apr 2020 21:13:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-d-is-for-dragons.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An effort to force myself to finish the Bestiary for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain at the End of the World.&lt;/a&gt; Stats are for &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;the GROG&lt;/a&gt;, so base AC is 0 ascending and base attack is 10 + HD ascending. Morale would be 7 or 8 + WIS modifier, if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like assigning it by fiat (you should assign it by fiat).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background &lt;a href=&#34;#background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragons are ancient and powerful creatures, each unique in their own right. Only a handful currently live, not more than twenty. Imagine you take the inventor of a deeply oppressive pseudoscience, make them both an aristocrat and the head of a vast and powerful organization devoted to the extractive accumulation of wealth, and put them in charge of a major intelligence service at the height of its power and madness and a band of slave-taking pillagers, which happen to be the same thing. That&amp;rsquo;s a dragon, or at least that&amp;rsquo;s all the dragons that are known to exist. They&amp;rsquo;re emphatically_very bad and very dangerous_ people. And that&amp;rsquo;s without going into their several tons of coiled serpentine muscle, iridium scales, and unequaled arcane power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A baby dragon is called a kobold. Hatched in great clutches of over a hundred, they are treated more as a disposable labor force than like children by their parents—sent out on longships from Iolund, frozen island home of the dragons, to capture slaves and treasure from the Pyrenican and Escautian coasts and sometimes further inland. If a kobold ever managed to hoard enough treasure and power, one could presumably become a dragon themselves. The dragons, however, take care to avoid letting this happen; kobolds that perform too well for too long at their roles are ritualistically eaten, to return their power to their draconic parent. Dragons aren&amp;rsquo;t fond of competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all kobolds are horrible draconic minions. Some, albeit few, flee or are exiled from their island home and make their way to other parts of the civilized lands to attempt to live out their lives in peace. The dragon-clans of course take advantage of this, and emplace spies pretending to be these &amp;ldquo;free kobolds&amp;rdquo; in numbers &lt;em&gt;at least&lt;/em&gt; equal to the genuine articles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dragons&#34;&gt;Dragons &lt;a href=&#34;#dragons&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 61 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Huge &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 15 (iridium scales, as plate + shield) &lt;strong&gt;Immune&lt;/strong&gt; to fire damage (both holy/consecrated and unholy/natural)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +5 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 50&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt; 120&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **20 +5 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 20 +5 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 20 +5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 21 melee bite or claw swipe 2d8+5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;/strong&gt; tail sweep 1d8+5 hits all in rear arc, roll Dexterity for half, knocked prone on failure&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Special&lt;/strong&gt; see wind-up attacks&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Common, Scale, High Charter, Imperial Court Obsequience, at least three other languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a &lt;em&gt;minimum&lt;/em&gt; stat block for a dragon. This is the weakest, smallest dragon on Iolund, or maybe a rogue exile found on the Mountain. This is a sickly dragon with a shitty, depleted clan of kobolds who all the other dragons make fun of. Put bigger numbers and more bells and whistles on stronger dragons appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iridium Scales:&lt;/strong&gt; Dragons have metallic scales that are harder and more dense than steel, granting them AC as plate + shield (+10). They&amp;rsquo;re also immune to fire damage and draconic poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unequaled Arcane Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Dragons are spellcasters with a level, MD, and known spells equal to their HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Ablative Saves: **If a dragon fails a roll to resist an effect, it can choose to succeed instead and take 20 damage.  Alternatively, it can take 10 damage and suffer from half the effect if that makes sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wind-Up Attacks:&lt;/strong&gt; Each round in combat, the dragon will either telegraph a wind-up attack, or perform a wind-up attack that was telegraphed on their last turn. It can&amp;rsquo;t telegraph the same wind-up attack that it performed last turn. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an &lt;strong&gt;action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poison Fire Breath.&lt;/strong&gt; 50&amp;rsquo; cone of 4d6 natural fire damage, roll Dexterity for half. Targets that breathe within the area also roll Strength or take 2d6 poison damage per round until a Strength roll is passed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smoke Exhalation.&lt;/strong&gt; As &lt;em&gt;fog&lt;/em&gt; cast with 5 MD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wing Beat.&lt;/strong&gt; Unsecured objects/creatures smaller than the dragon will be blown to end of 50&amp;rsquo; cone. Clears &lt;em&gt;fog.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pounce.&lt;/strong&gt; Dragon attempts to grapple target.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goblinpope wrote some good things &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/11/bosses.html&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on how to run a dragon (which i stole most of the above abilities from) and LaTorra has some &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.latorra.org/2012/05/15/a-16-hp-dragon/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, but I don&amp;rsquo;t see why they can&amp;rsquo;t have big stats &lt;strong&gt;too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;kobolds&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kobolds&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#kobolds&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Small &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 4, 1 E (kobold scales +1 AC, leather or padded armor) &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; 6, 3 E (with wooden round shield) &lt;strong&gt;Immune&lt;/strong&gt; to 5 points of fire damage (both holy/consecrated and unholy/natural) from each event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +1 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 11 melee waraxe 1d10 (no shield) &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; 11 melee seax 1d6 warblade (-1 difficulty and +1 damage vs humanoids) (with shield)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Common, Scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt; waraxe &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; seax knife and wooden round shield (50% chance each), leather or padded armor (50% chance each), 2d10 sp in coins and looted jewelry. More skilled kobolds often wear mail shirts and iron spangenhelms into battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kobold Scales:&lt;/strong&gt; While not nearly as tough as dragon scale, kobolds&amp;rsquo; scaly bodies still afford them +1 AC and decrease fire damage taken by 5 points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;warsong-berserker-skalds-and-runepriest-skull-scientists-playing-a-kobold&#34;&gt;Warsong Berserker Skalds and Runepriest Skull Scientists (Playing a Kobold) &lt;a href=&#34;#warsong-berserker-skalds-and-runepriest-skull-scientists-playing-a-kobold&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;When kobolds rise above the raider-minion milieu of their brethren, they do so as Warsong Berserker Skalds or Runepriest Skull Scientists. Raiding parties will usually be led by one or the other, and especially successful ones will usually contain multiples of both at various (sub-4th) levels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t play as a kobold if your party befriends the kobolds. They&amp;rsquo;re bastards, they&amp;rsquo;re not going to help you. You can play as a kobold if your party befriends a group of kobold &lt;em&gt;refugees&lt;/em&gt; who have forsaken their paranoid spymaster dragon parents and escaped to the Mountain. Reroll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity.&lt;/strong&gt; You have &lt;strong&gt;Kobold Scales.&lt;/strong&gt; You probably weigh about &lt;strong&gt;60 pounds&lt;/strong&gt; (this will be important later).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;warsong-berserker-skald&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warsong Berserker Skald&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#warsong-berserker-skald&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Mail shirt (4 AC 2 E), iron spangenhelm with looping eye mask and horns if you feel like it (1 AC 1 E), wooden round shield (2 AC 2 E), waraxe (medium headsplitter 1d10), shortspear (medium brace 1d8), kobold-sized straight sword (light warblade 1d6), drinking horn, frozen leg of mutton (5 rations), 6 torches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Breath:&lt;/strong&gt; You can breathe fire in a &lt;strong&gt;15&amp;rsquo; cone,&lt;/strong&gt; dealing &lt;strong&gt;[HD] d6&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;natural fire damage&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half. You can do this at most every other round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; the area of your fire breath increases to a &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo; cone.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warsong:&lt;/strong&gt; Your singing in battle emboldens your allies and intimidates your enemies. While you are singing, you and all allies within earshot get a bonus to &lt;strong&gt;STR Attack, Dex Attack,&lt;/strong&gt; and rolls against &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt;—and enemies take &lt;strong&gt;difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on attack rolls—equal to your &lt;strong&gt;HD.&lt;/strong&gt; Speaking short phrases doesn&amp;rsquo;t end your song, and you are assumed to be singing at all times in combat unless you say otherwise (for example, when attempting to be stealthy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Berserk:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;At second level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can fly into a bloodthirsty frenzy in combat. &lt;strong&gt;At the beginning of your turn or in response to receiving damage,&lt;/strong&gt; you can choose to enter a &lt;strong&gt;rage.&lt;/strong&gt; While in a &lt;strong&gt;rage,&lt;/strong&gt; you can make &lt;strong&gt;one additional attack per round,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;halve all damage taken,&lt;/strong&gt; and are &lt;strong&gt;immune to nonlethal damage&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;pain, fear, or other negative mind-affecting abilities,&lt;/strong&gt; but &lt;strong&gt;cannot take any defensive, curative, or tactical actions.&lt;/strong&gt; When combat is over, you must roll &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; to end your rage or continue fighting, attacking your allies. You can re-roll &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; once each round to end your &lt;strong&gt;rage.&lt;/strong&gt; Record all damage prevented through use of this ability—when your &lt;strong&gt;rage&lt;/strong&gt; ends, you take all of it at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frightful Presence: At second level,&lt;/strong&gt; you are such an intimidating presence on the battlefield that enemies flee before your mighty blows. When you &lt;strong&gt;down an opponent&lt;/strong&gt; you can immediately make an &lt;strong&gt;intimidate&lt;/strong&gt; special attack without spending an &lt;strong&gt;action.&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever you attempt to &lt;strong&gt;intimidate&lt;/strong&gt; opponents, they have &lt;strong&gt;+2 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on their &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; roll.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; the terror of facing you overwhelms ordinary opponents. Enemies that you have not personally attacked and who are not immune to &lt;strong&gt;fear&lt;/strong&gt; must roll &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; to attack you in melee combat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypnotic Song: At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can recite poetry so beautiful that it holds your audience captive. Listeners must roll &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; or become distracted and sit listening peacefully until and unless a direct threat to them presents itself. If you attempt this in combat, you must sing for &lt;strong&gt;1 round per HD&lt;/strong&gt; of the target with the highest &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; before the recital takes effect. If anyone other than the targets takes a directly threatening action during that time (parrying is OK, attacking isn&amp;rsquo;t) it automatically fails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; your recital can instead lull listeners into a restful sleep. Targets that fail their &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; roll lie &lt;strong&gt;prone&lt;/strong&gt; and fall into a natural slumber, if you wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragonform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; you attain the bare minimum of potential to become a &lt;strong&gt;dragon.&lt;/strong&gt; You grow massive, scaly wings &lt;strong&gt;(Fly speed 60&amp;rsquo;),&lt;/strong&gt; your scales harden &lt;strong&gt;(+1 AC),&lt;/strong&gt; and your tail lengthens (no mechanical effect). If you amass a hoard of pure gold equal to &lt;strong&gt;ten times your body weight,&lt;/strong&gt; anoint it with the captured soul of an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-is-for-angel.html&#34;&gt;angel,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; throw the thing you love most into a &lt;strong&gt;volcano,&lt;/strong&gt; and do &lt;strong&gt;one other suitably awesome and terrible thing,&lt;/strong&gt; you will fall into a nightmarish coma for &lt;strong&gt;1d6+6 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; the next time you sleep and awaken as a &lt;strong&gt;dragon.&lt;/strong&gt; Your draconic parent, whoever they are, will do their best to prevent this. Expect assassins, raiding parties, a full assault from your clan, and eventually your parent&amp;rsquo;s appearance in person, in that order, once you gain this ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;runepriest-skull-scientist&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Runepriest Skull Scientist&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#runepriest-skull-scientist&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;**Starting Equipment: **Leather armor (2 AC 1 E), iron skullcap (1 AC 1 E), sacrificial dagger (light close quarter 1d6), dragonborn whip (light chain reach 1d6), small hammer (light improvised crushing 1d4), skull-measuring calipers (as tongs), scrimshaw chisel, skull with your spells scrimshawed on it and a candle stuck on top, 20 candles, flint and steel and tinderbox, frozen side of pork (10 rations).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Spellcaster: **This is a wizard school. Your perks are &lt;strong&gt;kobold scales&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;dragonform.&lt;/strong&gt; Your drawback is that nobody trusts you, you probably have some shitty beliefs to work through, and your dragon parent will try to eat you if you reach fourth level. You are a &lt;strong&gt;spellcaster&lt;/strong&gt; and a &lt;strong&gt;white mage,&lt;/strong&gt; though your &lt;strong&gt;seals&lt;/strong&gt; are draconic rune-stones rather than sun-sigils. You know &lt;strong&gt;one spell from the warmind scrivener list&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;one spell from the witch list OR &lt;a href=&#34;http://unlawfulgames.blogspot.com/2018/07/osr-skull-wizard.html&#34;&gt;this list.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; At second and third, you can choose which list to roll on for your new spell. If you choose the skull wizard list at any level, roll 1d6 at first level, 1d8 at second level, and 1d10 at third level. At fourth level, pick four spells from any combination of the preceding lists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Cantrips: **&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Poison Breath.&lt;/strong&gt; You can breathe poison in a &lt;strong&gt;15&amp;rsquo; cone,&lt;/strong&gt; poisoning everything that breathes within the area and fails a **Strength **roll for &lt;strong&gt;1d6 damage per round&lt;/strong&gt; until a &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; roll is passed. You can do this at most every other round and are immune to draconic poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**At third level, **the area of your poison breath increases to a &lt;strong&gt;30&amp;rsquo; cone&lt;/strong&gt; and the damage increases to &lt;strong&gt;2d6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Know Skull.&lt;/strong&gt; You can identify any skull, knowing its species, sex, approximate age (both at time of death and currently), whether or not it was a spellcaster, and if it was, how many &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; it had at time of death and how many it could hold at maximum. Requires ten minutes of examination with your calipers and excited muttering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Scribe Rune.&lt;/strong&gt; You can create and dismiss permanent, inert glowing draconic runes with an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt; which shed light as a candle. You can also imbue spells into your runes, which go off targeting the rune or the reader (your choice at the time the rune is placed) when read or touched (also your choice at the time the rune is placed), destroying the rune. &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; invested in rune-spells do not return to your pool until the spell is triggered or the rune dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragonform:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; you attain the bare minimum of potential to become a &lt;strong&gt;dragon.&lt;/strong&gt; You grow massive, scaly wings &lt;strong&gt;(Fly speed 60&amp;rsquo;),&lt;/strong&gt; your scales harden &lt;strong&gt;(+1 AC),&lt;/strong&gt; and your tail lengthens (no mechanical effect). If you amass a hoard of pure gold equal to **ten times your body weight, **anoint it with the captured soul of an &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/bestiary-is-for-angel.html&#34;&gt;angel,&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; throw the thing you love most into a &lt;strong&gt;volcano,&lt;/strong&gt; and do &lt;strong&gt;one other suitably awesome and terrible thing,&lt;/strong&gt; you will fall into a nightmarish coma for &lt;strong&gt;1d6+6 weeks&lt;/strong&gt; the next time you sleep and awaken as a &lt;strong&gt;dragon.&lt;/strong&gt; Your draconic parent, whoever they are, will do their best to prevent this. Expect assassins, raiding parties, a full assault from your clan, and eventually your parent&amp;rsquo;s appearance in person, in that order, once you gain this ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&#34;dragonborn&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dragonborn&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#dragonborn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 5 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 2 (false scales) **Immune **to 5 points of fire damage (both holy/consecrated and unholy/natural) from each event&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +0 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt; 30&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **12 +1 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 12 melee greataxe 2d8+2 headsplitter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Common, Scale, former languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt; greataxe (heavy headsplitter melee 2d8), tattered rags&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dragonborn are the results of fell experiments performed on captive subjects by dragons and runepriest skull scientists. The above stat block was probably a hobgoblin before its transformation. They are driven into combat before kobold armies, hissing and shrieking, determined to free themselves through death in battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Scales:&lt;/strong&gt; A dragonborn has had their skin toughened and heavy steel scales affixed to it through obscene alchemical processes. These grant them +2 AC and the same resistance to fire that kobolds have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;False Breath:&lt;/strong&gt; A dragonborn has had their flesh infused with dark magic in an effort to mimic the breath weapon of their creators. They can spew forth a 15&amp;rsquo; cone of poisonous liquid flame and acrid smoke, dealing 1d6 natural fire damage with a Dexterity roll for half and causing targets hit that have exposed skin and a circulatory system to roll Strength or be poisoned for 1d6 damage per round until they succeed at a Strength roll. The dragonborn can do this at most once every other round, and suffers 1d6 damage themselves each time. Dragonborn are not immune to draconic poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tatterdemalion Wings:&lt;/strong&gt; A dragonborn has tattered, frankenstein-esque wings clumsily stitched to their shoulders, and new muscles grafted to their bodies to control them. They have a fly speed of 30&amp;rsquo; and really shitty maneuverability. They can fly for a maximum number of rounds equal to their &lt;strong&gt;Strength,&lt;/strong&gt; at which points they must rest for an hour before flying again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiments-playing-a-dragonborn&#34;&gt;Experiments (Playing a Dragonborn) &lt;a href=&#34;#experiments-playing-a-dragonborn&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dragonborn are even more likely to flee Iolund if given the chance, though precious few chances exist. Those that make it out are seen as tragic figures, their monstrous transformation preventing them from returning to the lives they once had, even if said life was not destroyed by the same raid that captured them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play a dragonborn if your party aids a number of dragonborn in escaping a draconic raiding party, you want a tragic backstory, and the rest of your party is cool with it. Choose another species first, and apply all of their modifiers and rerolls. Then reroll &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; again, and reroll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; and take the lower result. You have &lt;strong&gt;false scales, false breath,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;tatterdemalion wings.&lt;/strong&gt; As a dragonborn you advance in whatever classes you would normally have access to, or the kobold classes. If you choose a kobold class you don&amp;rsquo;t get &lt;strong&gt;dragonform&lt;/strong&gt; at fourth level but your creator clan will come after you anyway, although the dragon itself probably won&amp;rsquo;t bother to show up.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bestiary: C is for Cave Beasts &amp; Companions</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-c-is-for-cave-beasts-companions.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 18:36:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-c-is-for-cave-beasts-companions.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This&amp;rsquo;ll be a short one, just the essentials. You need stats for dogs and horses, and I need to write the words &amp;ldquo;spiderwolf&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;cave pigeon, giant&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An effort to force myself to finish the Bestiary for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain at the End of the World.&lt;/a&gt; Stats are for &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;the GROG&lt;/a&gt;, so base AC is 0 ascending and base attack is 10 + HD ascending. Morale would be 7 or 8 + WIS modifier, if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like assigning it by fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;dogs&#34;&gt;Dogs &lt;a href=&#34;#dogs&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogs are a perversion of the canine form, one of nature’s great servants turned to serve mankind. Every dog burns with an internal fire, as can be seen in the smoke that issues from their panting mouths. They are the ultimate scavengers, capable of sustaining themselves on meat, vegetables, fruit wood, coal, oil, or any other digestible or flammable substance. Many families keep dogs as companions, especially those who reside in areas such as the Mountain where the forests are too dangerous to log—besides the security that a well-trained guard dog provides, their body temperature is sufficient to heat a small home through the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Famous Nose:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs can track targets across long distances by smell, and &lt;strong&gt;ignore difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on rolls to detect things that have a scent. Wolves and other doglike beasts can too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Flame:&lt;/strong&gt; Dogs never take damage from normal cold weather, and confer this benefit to companions of their size or smaller so long as they remain in close contact—riding or being carried by the dog and sleeping snug up against it, for example. Non-dog animals of similar size and nature (wolves, hyenas, jackals, coyotes, et cetera) don&amp;rsquo;t possess this ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dog-common-working&#34;&gt;Dog, Common Working &lt;a href=&#34;#dog-common-working&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Small &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 2 (unarmored)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Arqot, excitedly and happily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working dogs weigh about 20 to 50 pounds, and are common throughout the few bastions of civilization on the Mountain. These stats can also be used for doglike animals like coyotes, dingoes, hyenas, and jackals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;dog-war&#34;&gt;Dog, War &lt;a href=&#34;#dog-war&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 2 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 10 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 2 (unarmored)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +2 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 40&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **12 +1 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 2 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 13 melee bite 1d6+1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Arqot, boldly and brashly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;War dogs are nearly the size of a hobgoblin. They are large enough for small characters like goblins to ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takedown:&lt;/strong&gt; When a war dog hits with a bite attack, they can make a &lt;strong&gt;free combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; to trip their target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;hill-wolf&#34;&gt;Hill Wolf &lt;a href=&#34;#hill-wolf&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 2 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 10 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 4 (unarmored)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +4 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 40&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **12 +1 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 2 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 13 melee bite 1d6+1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Serumic, cruelly and hungrily&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolves, red in tooth and claw, are one of the favored beasts of the natural element of blood. They have been innoculated against Arqot, and the sound of it sends them into a slavering frenzy in which they will attack those they hear speak it heedless of their own safety. Wolves use pack tactics when fighting, seeking to encircle their opponents and drag them to the ground before moving in for the kill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Takedown:&lt;/strong&gt; When a hill wolf hits with a bite attack, they can make a &lt;strong&gt;free combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt; to trip their target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photophobia:&lt;/strong&gt; Hill wolves roll &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; to enter areas of bright light. If they fail, they cannot enter and lurk on its boundaries, staring with palpable fury. They can try again once every minute. Those brave enough to charge torchbearers are canny enough to wrestle them to the ground and snuff out the light so their packmates can approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;spiderwolf&#34;&gt;Spiderwolf &lt;a href=&#34;#spiderwolf&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 2 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 10 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 6 (spider chitin, as leather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +4 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 50&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Climb&lt;/strong&gt; 50&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **12 +1 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 16 +3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 2 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 13 melee bite 1d6+1 + roll Strength or poison 1d6/round until Strength roll passed&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Serumic, Skittering, in an alien and predatory manner&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Terrifying combinations of arachnid and beast, spiderwolves are agile, skittering abominations with all the cunning of a wolf married to the patience—and venom—of a man-sized monstrous spider. They can be found on the upper slopes of the Mountain as well as inside and beneath it, but sometimes venture lower into the foothills. It’s not unheard of for spiderwolves to join ordinary wolf packs on occasion, a frightening prospect for those who make it their business to hunt wolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chitinous Pelt:&lt;/strong&gt; Spiderwolves are protected by sturdy chitin as well as thick ruffs of fur, giving them +2 AC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;equines&#34;&gt;Equines &lt;a href=&#34;#equines&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horses were one of the first species to be domesticated in the civilized lands, and nature has fully cast them out. There is no part of a horse made of anything natural; no ash and no fish, certainly, but also no bone nor blood. Their skeleton is composed of a gelatinous cartilage and their veins filled with oil. When they burn—because they are so very flammable—they leave no ashes, just a puddle of horrible, melted cartilaginous glue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horsehide:&lt;/strong&gt; Horses have tough, leathery skin that grants them +2 AC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oil in the Blood:&lt;/strong&gt; Horses are filled with oil, and very susceptible to ignition. If an attack or other effect normally has a chance to ignite targets, horses automatically catch fire. Even when taking fire damage that does not normally carry a chance of ignition, they must roll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; or burst into flame for 1d6 damage per round until extinguished. They bleed oil when cut, and can be healed 1d6 HP (horse points) by forcing them to drink a pint of oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;pony-ass-or-burro&#34;&gt;Pony, Ass, or Burro &lt;a href=&#34;#pony-ass-or-burro&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 5 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 3 (horsehide, as leather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +1 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 40&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **12 +1 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 2 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 12 melee kick 1d6+1&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; No languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ponies, asses, and burros are all common pack animals, and large enough to serve as a mount for a small creature like a goblin. A pony, ass, or burro can carry about 200 pounds before it starts staggering around like an idiot or just gives up and lies down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;horse-light-or-mule&#34;&gt;Horse, Light or Mule &lt;a href=&#34;#horse-light-or-mule&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 2 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 13 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Large &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 4 (horsehide, as leather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +2 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 60&amp;rsquo; (light horse) &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; 40&amp;rsquo; (mule)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **14 +2 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 2 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 14 melee kick 1d6+2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; No languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light horses are commonly bred for speed and beauty, and can carry about 400 pounds. Mules are slower but make much better working animals, and can carry around 600 pounds. Either can drag five times their carrying limit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;horse-heavy&#34;&gt;Horse, Heavy &lt;a href=&#34;#horse-heavy&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 25 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Large &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 3 (horsehide, as leather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +1 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 50&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **18 +4 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 2 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 17 melee kick or trample 1d6+4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; No languages&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heavy horses are excellent workers, strong and slow to tire. They can carry 450 pounds easily, 900 pounds at maximum, or drag just over two tons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cave-pigeon-giant&#34;&gt;Cave Pigeon, Giant &lt;a href=&#34;#cave-pigeon-giant&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 34 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Large &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 0 (unarmored)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +0 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt; 60&#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 1 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 6 -2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 18 bite 2d6+4&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; The birds are an enigma, you cannot speak with them &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Giant cave pigeons stalk the internal caverns and tunnels of the Mountain, using their steel-hard beaks to chip away at the stone and form their filthy burrow-nests. They are large, aggressive, and invariably hostile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blindsense:&lt;/strong&gt; The underdeveloped eyes of a cave pigeon register only the presence or absence of light, but they have developed &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; senses to compensate. They suffer no penalties from being blind, but are only aware of creatures within 60 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;cave-pike-giant&#34;&gt;Cave Pike, Giant &lt;a href=&#34;#cave-pike-giant&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 2 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 34 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 2 (fish scale, as leather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +0 &lt;strong&gt;Swim&lt;/strong&gt; 60&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **14 +2 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 1 -4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 6 -2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 14 bite 1d8+2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Hadeal, clumsily and stupidly&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The terror of Mountain fisherfolk, giant cave pike are ill-tempered beasts that will happily capsize a rowboat or dinghy to get at the meat inside. Those who have ventured into the Mountain itself tell that the pale specimens which live in the subterranean rivers and lakes beneath it are even larger and more malicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish Scales:&lt;/strong&gt; Giant cave pike scales are tough and slippery, giving them +2 AC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;chimera&#34;&gt;Chimera &lt;a href=&#34;#chimera&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 57 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Huge &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 4 (tough hide or scales, as leather)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +2 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 40&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt; 60&amp;rsquo;, if winged&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; 20 +5 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 21 talon, claw, or hoof 1d8+5&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 21 bite or gore 2d6+5 (if able)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Varies, see below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimerae are strange beasts, seemingly cobbled together from parts of others. Their origin is unknown—some think them a terror born of the natural world, others that they are the experiments of mad wizards. Chimerae vary dramatically in form, but some combinations breed true and have created well-known subspecies: Gryphons, hippogryphs, sphinges, manticores, owlbears, pegasi, and “true” chimerae.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough:&lt;/strong&gt; Chimerae have either thick leathery hides or scales, granting them +2 AC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;chimerae-generation&#34;&gt;Chimerae Generation &lt;a href=&#34;#chimerae-generation&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d6 What form is its body?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body of a bear, upright, with feathered and taloned winglike arms..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body of a horse, feathered wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body of a cheetah, leathery bat-wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body of a lion, feathered wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body of a lion, scaled bat-wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Body of a lion with the forelimbs and chest of an eagle, feathered wings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;d8 And what of its head?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of a goblinoid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of an orc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of a lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of an eagle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of an owl.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Head of a bull.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three heads—one draconic, one leonine, and one goat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimerae with wings can fly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimerae with draconic, eagle, lion, or owl heads have bite attacks, and chimerae with bull or goat heads have gore attacks. Chimerae with three heads can make three attacks with no additional &lt;strong&gt;difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; for making multiple attacks in a round. Chimerae with draconic heads can also breathe fire after visibly &amp;ldquo;winding up&amp;rdquo; for 1 round (sharp inhalation, torches gutter and candles and lamps blow out, etc), dealing &lt;strong&gt;4d6 natural fire damage&lt;/strong&gt; in a &lt;strong&gt;50 foot cone&lt;/strong&gt; with a &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; roll for half—in rounds where the chimerae winds up or breathes fire, the draconic head cannot also make a bite attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chimerae with humanoid (goblinoid or orcish) heads speak Common, and chimerae with draconic heads speak Scale. The intelligence of chimerae vary as widely as their forms do; some are incredibly wise, and others no more than hungry beasts.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bestiary: B is for Beastman (races &amp; classes &amp; monsters, oh my)</title>

      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-b-is-for-beastman-races.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An effort to force myself to finish the Bestiary for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain at the End of the World.&lt;/a&gt; Stats are for &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;the GROG&lt;/a&gt;, so base AC is 0 ascending and base attack is 10 + HD ascending. Morale would be 7 + CHA modifier, if you don&amp;rsquo;t feel like assigning it by fiat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those of these that have a class associated with them are playable, if the players have built a solid enough relationship with their cultures to justify it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of things in here are stolen from other blogs, particularly &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/03/general-manufacturing-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;crab man builders&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/01/gretchlings-and-grues.html&#34;&gt;ratmen&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;beastmen&#34;&gt;Beastmen &lt;a href=&#34;#beastmen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;lsquo;Beastman&amp;rsquo; is a catch-all term for sentient humanoids found on, in, or under the Mountain that are not present in the civilized lands of the Old World and thus not, at least by most, considered &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo;. Many of them are just as smart, sophisticated, and ethical as &amp;lsquo;humans&amp;rsquo; despite this, though perhaps in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;alpaca-men&#34;&gt;Alpaca Men &lt;a href=&#34;#alpaca-men&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Small &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 3 (leather)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt; 3 shortspears (medium brace 1d8, throw 30&amp;rsquo;), leather armor (AC 2 E 1), 2d10 intricately painted wooden beads worth 1 sp each&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alpaca men are goblin-sized, but have long necks that bring their heads nearly to eye level for a hobgoblin or orc. They live in small, single-family dwelling clusters woven from their own wool—of which they produce a prodigious amount. Their homesteads are distributed throughout their alpine territory, semi-nomadic and often camouflaged as a defensive strategy against the much more numerous, larger, and more violent llamafolk polity present in the same area with which they are constantly at war. They are prone to paranoia and machismo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surefooted:&lt;/strong&gt; Alpaca men can move at full speed without rolling Dexterity on sloped or broken ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wool Coat:&lt;/strong&gt; Unless recently sheared, alpaca men take half damage from cold effects, always count as having protective equipment against cold weather, and treat temperate or warmer weather as dangerously hot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spit:&lt;/strong&gt; Alpaca men can spit up a sticky mass of spittle and chewed grass as a ranged attack within 30&amp;rsquo;. If the attack hits, their target is blind until they spend a full round clearing the mess from their eyes. Alpaca men can&amp;rsquo;t use this ability while hungry, and must eat between each use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;beaded-knights-playing-an-alpaca-man&#34;&gt;Beaded Knights (Playing an Alpaca Man) &lt;a href=&#34;#beaded-knights-playing-an-alpaca-man&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beaded knights of the alpaca men (a reclusive order of militant rangers, cultural heroes, so named because they weave wooden and metal beads into their coats to form a sort of permanent armor) are known to intentionally consume poison as a part of their training. This both grants them improved resistance to it, and causes their spittle to carry blinding toxins for a much greater effect in combat&amp;ndash;it also shortens their lifespans dramatically, but few beaded knights survive long enough in their service for this to concern them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play a beaded knight if your party befriends the alpaca men, perhaps by defending them from a llamafolk raid or helping them recover some familial artifact that was stolen in a previous attack. Reroll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Hundreds of wooden and metal beads woven into coat (4 AC 0 E), shortbow (heavy bow, 1d6) with 20 arrows, 2 copper hand axes (light headsplitter melee, 1d6, throw 10&amp;rsquo;), snow goggles, rucksack, long and hooded wool cloak with scrub grass woven through it, waterskin, 4 rations of dried ryegrass hay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bead Armor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You know the exact methods necessary to weave small beads of wood and metal through your wool coat to grant you protection without the bulk or encumbrance of armor. You have +4 AC, which does not stack with worn armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poison Eater&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Throughout your training as a beaded knight, you subjected yourself to increasing doses of poison. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t live past five years (where alpaca men normally live twenty) but suffer only half the penalties or damage of any poison introduced into your system, and your spit blinds living things for 1 hour even after cleared from their eyes unless immune to poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pathfinder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**At second level, **your skill at overland travel and navigation allows you to effectively lead a party through even the roughest terrain. When travelling, your entire party moves at full speed over rough, sloped, or broken ground and half speed through normally impassable terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skirmish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**At second level, **you can use continual movement in combat to throw off your enemies and strike from unexpected directions. When you move at least 30 feet in a combat round, your attacks deal an extra +1d6 damage and you get +2 AC until the beginning of your next turn.&lt;br&gt;
**At fourth level, **this damage increases by an additional +1d6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alpinism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
**At third level, **long exposure to high altitudes and Mountain air has strengthened your system even despite the poison coursing through your veins.Your heart rate is slower, your lung capacity is greater, and your blood is better able to transfer oxygen. You get +2 Strength.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Vanish&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; you have an almost supernatural ability to disappear into natural terrain. Whenever out of doors and not directly observed, you can disappear completely without spending an action. You can reappear at any time in any place you could conceivably have reached during the time you were vanished.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Perfect Shot&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; you attain a level of marksmanship that defies explanation. Once per combat, you can make a ranged attack that automatically critically hits within double your weapon&amp;rsquo;s range. Declare this before making the attack. Outside of combat, you can use this ability to do anything one could conceivably do with a trick shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As alpaca men, but nearly double the height—five feet tall at the shoulder, just over eight in total—and much stronger. Llamafolk live in fortified villages organized around a warlord-matriarch, but often range far from their homes in raiding parties. Contact with organized llamafolk has been almost universally hostile, but individual ones can often be negotiated with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;goatmen&#34;&gt;Goatmen &lt;a href=&#34;#goatmen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;As llamafolk, but no Wool Coat or Spit abilities. Instead, goatmen have horns and hooves (light crushing melee 1d6) and can see into the souls of those that meet their horizontally-pupilled gaze. This is mostly useful for creeping people out but also means it&amp;rsquo;s practically impossible to lie to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goatmen live in permanent clan-gatherings, easily recognizable from afar by their pointed thatch towerhuts and sturdy palisades. Their villages are generally closed to outsiders, but interaction outside of that varies based on the attitudes of the clan in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since my orcs are people, these are my &amp;ldquo;orcs&amp;rdquo;. Llamafolk live high on the Mountain, goatmen live in the foothills and plains around it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bat men are nocturnal denizens of the upper layers of Mountain caverns, occasionally venturing onto the surface to hunt. They organize themselves into loose semi-nomadic tribal structures of up to a hundred individuals, moving from cavern to cavern as they exhaust the local wildlife. They have been known to hunt humans when they intrude on their territory, and are widely regarded as monsters although not all contact has been violent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echolocation:&lt;/strong&gt; Bat men navigate by emitting clicking, chirping noises and listening for the echoes. They do not count as blind when interacting with solid objects within 60 feet of them, but are blind in areas of magical silence and have trouble navigating wide-open spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since my goblins are also people, these are (some of) my &amp;ldquo;goblins&amp;rdquo;. These ones can fly but do less wonky/dangerous &amp;ldquo;goblin&amp;rdquo; shit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crab men inhabit the coastal and littoral zones of the Mountain, in cave-villages bored into stone cliffs and sea floors. They are organized into three castes; hunters, builders, and shamans—each caste has a suite of trademark invocations, taught to them by shamanic caste-keepers. Check the caste system bit below, all crab men should probably have at least an A template in their caste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crab Body:&lt;/strong&gt; Crab men have thick shells that grant them armor as plate (+7 AC) and giant crab pincers (medium crushing melee 1d8). Also, they&amp;rsquo;re slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;caste-system-playing-a-crab-man&#34;&gt;Caste System (Playing a Crab Man) &lt;a href=&#34;#caste-system-playing-a-crab-man&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hunters learn charms to hide them and allow them to set ambushes for their prey or turn their shells and pincers as hard and sharp as steel, and double as warriors when the cave-village needs protection. Builders learn castings to bore new burrows out of solid stone, and create permanent portals between villages known as &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.terminally-incoherent.com/blog/2014/07/28/arrested-development-my-troglodytes-are-different/&#34;&gt;waystones&lt;/a&gt;. Shamans learn whatever they can, imbuing the appropriate powers into other crab men according to their caste, and have access to some powers exclusive to them in the event of matters facing a cave-village that defy solving through the typical actions of hunters and builders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play a crab man if your party befriends the crab men, perhaps by destroying all caches of butter and lemons in the nearby outposts of &amp;ldquo;civilization&amp;rdquo;, or by gifting to them a great volume of jewelry. Crab men love jewelry. Big heavy necklaces to hang precariously from their eye stalks and delicate tiaras to balance atop their shells. Reroll &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; and then &lt;strong&gt;add 2&lt;/strong&gt; to the higher roll, then reroll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; and take the lower of each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Equipment:&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing. Maybe a couple shells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess crab men are a wizard school. Your perk is that you have a crab shell and crab claws, and your drawback is that you&amp;rsquo;re slow as hell and have shitty Dexterity and Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can pick hunter, builder, or shaman. If you&amp;rsquo;re a hunter or builder, you only gain your caste&amp;rsquo;s cantrips and spells—they were imbued into your crab-ichor by a shaman when you were but a hatchling. If you&amp;rsquo;re a shaman, roll your cantrips and spells randomly and also gain the following ability: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caste-Keeper&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As a crab man shaman,&lt;/strong&gt; you can imbue your spells and cantrips into un-caste-ed crab men at will, turning them into either a hunter or a builder. In addition, you can transfer any spell you know (whether it&amp;rsquo;s a crab man spell or not) along with &lt;strong&gt;1 MD&lt;/strong&gt; to any target (caste-ed, crab man, or otherwise) with a touch. In this case, the &lt;strong&gt;MD&lt;/strong&gt; and spell return to you at dawn the next day regardless of whether they have been expended or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Cantrips **&lt;br&gt;
Roll a d8 three times if you&amp;rsquo;re a shaman, rerolling duplicates, otherwise just take your caste&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1-hunter. &lt;strong&gt;Find Fish.&lt;/strong&gt; You know the rough direction and distance of the largest fish within 1 kilometer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2-hunter.&lt;strong&gt;Purge Poison.&lt;/strong&gt; Target previously living thing becomes safe to eat, at least for crab men. You  can only use this on something that is very recently (within the last minute or so) deceased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3-hunter. &lt;strong&gt;Crab of Violence.&lt;/strong&gt; Count your STR Attack as 1 higher when attacking with your pincers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4-builder. &lt;strong&gt;Snibb Snibb.&lt;/strong&gt; Something you&amp;rsquo;re touching is snipped as if with one of your pincers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5-builder. &lt;strong&gt;Soften Stone.&lt;/strong&gt; You can soften solid stone enough to snip through it, removing any damage reduction from up to a 5 foot cube of stone for 1 hour. It takes one crab-hour of labor to clear a 5 foot cube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6-builder. &lt;strong&gt;Crab of Purpose.&lt;/strong&gt; You can harden crude tools to function as well as their forged iron counterparts as long as you yourself are using them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7-shaman. &lt;strong&gt;Control Currents.&lt;/strong&gt; Water in a 5 foot radius around you lies still and unable to move on its own. Cancels the effects of currents, rapids, fast-flowing rivers and streams, undertow, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8-shaman. &lt;strong&gt;Crab of Knowledge.&lt;/strong&gt; You can fully identify all properties of any magical effect or artefact by drinking saltwater that it has been immersed in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crab Spells&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If you&amp;rsquo;re a hunter or builder, you get spells from your caste in order—#1 &amp;amp; #2 at first level, #3 at second level, #4 at third level, and your emblem spell at fourth level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re a shaman, flip a coin for hunter or builder at each level (once for each spell at first level). You learn the shaman emblem spell at fourth level instead of either caste&amp;rsquo;s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes this is less spells than a normal wizard but whatever, they&amp;rsquo;re good spells I promise. Also you can still learn new spells like a normal wizard, it&amp;rsquo;ll just make other crab men think you&amp;rsquo;re weird, especially if you&amp;rsquo;re not a shaman.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter 1. &lt;strong&gt;Trapdoor Crab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: self T: self D: instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You camouflage yourself into nearby terrain. You cannot be noticed without magic as long as you do not move. If you make an attack or similar action from this state, enemies are considered surprised.&lt;br&gt;
Hunter 2. &lt;strong&gt;Leap&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;R: self T: self D: instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You almost-instantly leap a distance equal to your speed. If you collide with something, both you and it take [sum] damage with a Dexterity roll for half, and the object you collided with is forced back 5 feet. Casting this spell doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an action, but can only be done once per round. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hunter 3. &lt;strong&gt;Pistol Crab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: creature D: [dice] hoursThe target touched grows a giant crab-pincer over their main hand. If they already have pincers, it&amp;rsquo;s a medium spike weapon that does one additional die of damage, and can be used in melee &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; snapped to deal damage up to 10 feet away with concussive force. If they don&amp;rsquo;t already have pincers, it&amp;rsquo;s a normal crab man pincer (medium crushing melee 1d8, scale die up or down depending on size difference from medium or small). You can target yourself with this spell.&lt;br&gt;
Hunter 4. &lt;strong&gt;Envenom&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: object or creature D: [dice] minutes&lt;br&gt;
You imbue a touched object with powerful venom. Your pincer is a natural choice, but you could also use it to poison food, a touched target, et cetera. This acts as a poison that deals [sum] damage.&lt;br&gt;
Hunter Emblem. &lt;strong&gt;Giant Enemy Crab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: arthropod D: [dice] hours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The arthropod touched doubles in size, and its carapace hardens into steel. As &lt;em&gt;enlarge&lt;/em&gt; plus its HP is doubled, any claws or pincers it has are affected as though by &lt;em&gt;pistol crab,&lt;/em&gt; and all effects normally associated with steel armor and weapons. It also gains a weak point that can be attacked for massive damage—receiving a critical hit automatically ends the spell.&lt;br&gt;
Builder 1. &lt;strong&gt;Crabricate&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: n/a T: your inventory D: permanent&lt;br&gt;
You produce [sum] slots of low-quality shell, coral, or stone tools out of thin air. Each will break after one use.&lt;br&gt;
Builder 2. &lt;strong&gt;Molt&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: creature D: instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The target touched quickly sheds its skin or carapace and grows a new one, healing [sum] HP. The old skin or carapace remains, sloughed off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builder 3. &lt;strong&gt;Crab Spike&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: [dice] * 5 feet T: line D: instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You produce a bipointed staple of shell, coral, or stone that punches forth with enough force to rivet steel. If used as an attack, roll an attack roll against the first target in line, dealing [sum]+[dice] damage. If it misses the first target or deals enough damage to reduce them to 0 HP, roll an attack against the next target in line for any damage not yet assigned, &amp;amp;c, &amp;amp;c. If targeted to restrain rather than wound, the staple deals no damage but pins them on a successful attack roll and has 10 AC and 10 HP, or can be burst with a Strength check at 10 difficulty. You can also use it to staple things together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builder 4. &lt;strong&gt;Encrustacean&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: touch T: creature or object D: permanent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The touched target turns into a crab, of approximately the same mass as it originally was. This gives life and the ability to speak Skittering, but not undue intelligence, to inanimate objects, and can affect targets of up to your size. Unwilling targets roll Charisma to resist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Builder Emblem. &lt;strong&gt;Crabworks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: sight T: [sum] 10 foot cubes D: concentration, then instantaneous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You reshape the target area of terrain to your liking. This is slow, taking an hour of concentration to reach full effect as land slowly slides into place, etc. You can&amp;rsquo;t use this ability to create or destroy mass, but you can change densities within reason—for example to create sturdy tunnels or expand an boulder into a foamy mass that fills the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shaman Emblem. &lt;strong&gt;Crab World&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
R: sight T: [dice] mile radius centered around point D: [dice] * [sum] days&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weather and nonmagical beasts within the area bend themselves to your will, within their natural limits. In addition, any creatures within the area become gradually more crablike, as if affected by an &lt;em&gt;encrustacean&lt;/em&gt; spell that takes effect slowly over the first week of the spell&amp;rsquo;s effect or the first week they spend within the spell&amp;rsquo;s area while it is active. If they spend the entire week within the spell&amp;rsquo;s area while it remains active, the effects are permanent and persist beyond the duration of the spell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fishmaid is a misnomer, for they are neither fish nor maid. More like manatees with a maw of fierce jagged teeth. So named because, while sunning themselves on a rock, they look &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; like a comely woman as long as you&amp;rsquo;re a sailor who&amp;rsquo;s been on a ship for the past four months and are looking at them through dense fog. Fishmaids are omnivores, but will happily sink a rowboat or fishing launch and feast on the tender humans inside if the opportunity presents itself. They are not sapient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tough Hide:&lt;/strong&gt; Fishmaids have thick, leathery hides that grant them +3 AC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Siren Song:&lt;/strong&gt; Fishmaids &amp;ldquo;sing&amp;rdquo; while sunning themselves. The song sounds like sultry crooning, though no words can be made out. Any who hear it roll Intelligence or are convinced that it is actually sung by an intelligent being, unless they&amp;rsquo;ve rolled successfully against it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;DEX Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 10 range 10&amp;rsquo; spores, see ability text&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Decay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mushroom people. I don&amp;rsquo;t know how else to say it, they&amp;rsquo;re mushroom people. Live in the deepest caverns under the Mountain that have been breached so far. Generally nonhostile, but capable of defending themselves. Don&amp;rsquo;t understand flesh-creatures or the surface world very well. Myconids don&amp;rsquo;t need to sleep, and can subsist on dirt and rotting wood or flesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fungal Vision:&lt;/strong&gt; Myconids can see as well in dim light as humans do in sunlight. Bright light hurts them, causing 1 damage per minute of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fungal Body:&lt;/strong&gt; Myconids get an additional &lt;strong&gt;2 HP&lt;/strong&gt; per level/HD. They take &lt;strong&gt;double damage&lt;/strong&gt; from fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spores:&lt;/strong&gt; Myconids have spores. They can apply these spores to their unarmed melee attacks, project them as a ranged attack with a range of 10 feet, or release them in a 5-foot radius cloud as an action or in response to taking damage. Spores affect only creatures with flesh or flesh-like bodies (like plans and fungi), are resisted by rolling &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; with the myconid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;difficulty,&lt;/strong&gt; and last one hour unless otherwise specified. All myconids have the following types of spores, some may have more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rapport.&lt;/strong&gt; Allows telepathic communication with the myconid while touching it or any surface coated with rapport spores that it is also touching.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psychedelic.&lt;/strong&gt; Produces vivid, colorful hallucinations—easy to distinguish from reality, but distracting nonetheless. Applies &lt;strong&gt;difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; equal to the myconid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; to all d20 rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Endothermic.&lt;/strong&gt; Freezes when exposed to light, causing 1 damage per round exposed to dim light, 1d4 per round exposed to torch or lantern light, 1d8 per round exposed to brighter light, and 2d6 per round exposed to sunlight. Each application can deal maximum total damage equal to the myconid&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; times ten before being completely burnt out.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luminescent.&lt;/strong&gt; Provides dim light in a 5 foot radius.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;fruiting-bodies-playing-a-myconid&#34;&gt;Fruiting Bodies (Playing a Myconid) &lt;a href=&#34;#fruiting-bodies-playing-a-myconid&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some myconids have the capability to produce even more fantastic spore effects. While most of these will be found in key roles or at the head of a myconid family-culture, if they needed to send a body out of their caverns, this is who they would choose to send.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can play a myconid if your party befriends the myconids. It&amp;rsquo;s actually quite easy to befriend the myconids; just don&amp;rsquo;t burn them with your torches and lanterns. The hard part is getting to them in the first place, and then getting back out again. Reroll &lt;strong&gt;Charisma,&lt;/strong&gt; then reroll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; and take the lower result for each. Also note that you&amp;rsquo;re slow and don&amp;rsquo;t need to (and can&amp;rsquo;t) sleep or really eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fruiting Body&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You produce budding fungal children each day as long as you are well-fed, to a maximum of your &lt;strong&gt;HD.&lt;/strong&gt; If removed from your body, they wither and die within 24 hours, but if eaten before then they heal &lt;strong&gt;1d8 HP&lt;/strong&gt; and count as a ration. If planted and allowed to mature in mostly moist, nutrient-rich substrate, they will grow into a new myconid within one year. You have no compunctions about eating your children, or allowing others to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mycotoxin&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At second level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can produce potent toxic spores in addition to your standard types. This acts as a &lt;strong&gt;poison&lt;/strong&gt; that deals &lt;strong&gt;1d6 damage per HD.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Histoplasma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can produce spores that link with subjects&amp;rsquo; neural systems and cause fatigue and apathy in addition to your standard types. If the subject fails their &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; roll to resist the spores, they are &lt;strong&gt;stunned&lt;/strong&gt; for 1 round, then &lt;strong&gt;fatigued&lt;/strong&gt; for 1 hour and suffer &lt;strong&gt;2 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on all d20 rolls. If they pass their roll, they are still &lt;strong&gt;fatigued&lt;/strong&gt; for the duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cordyceps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can produce spores that invade and colonize the neural functions of dead creatures. If the subject fails their &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; roll to resist the spores (yes they get one even though they&amp;rsquo;re dead), they are animated as a fungal zombie under your control. Arthropod corpses don&amp;rsquo;t get to roll. Fungal zombies have their original &lt;strong&gt;Strength,&lt;/strong&gt; half their original &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity,&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;2 (-4) Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Charisma,&lt;/strong&gt; move a maximum of **20&amp;rsquo; per round, **and attack as &lt;strong&gt;1 HD&lt;/strong&gt; creatures. Fungal zombies last until destroyed or released (see below), not one hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can control a number of fungal zombies equal to your level—if you pass this limit, any additional ones (you can choose which) succumb back to death—which follow commands spoken by you in Decay or through your Rapport spores. Once a creature has been animated as a fungal zombie once, it can&amp;rsquo;t be reanimated again. Fungal zombies are fungus, not undead, though they certainly &lt;em&gt;appear&lt;/em&gt; undead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;rock-leeches&#34;&gt;Rock Leeches &lt;a href=&#34;#rock-leeches&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 5 (leech-hide, as scale) &lt;strong&gt;Half&lt;/strong&gt; damage from sharp things and fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +5 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 40&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Swim&lt;/strong&gt; 40&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 12 +1 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 6 -2 **Charisma **10 +0&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEX Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 12 melee slashers 1d6+1 spike, heals for damage dealt&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Hadeal, Serumic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock leeches are terrible semihumanoid beasts, with flat eyeless faces pierced only by nostril- and ear-slits and yawning, horrible maws of needle-teeth. Their skin is tough like rhinoceros hide and wet like an oilslick, and their hands end in bundles of razor-sharp claws like broken glass. They seem to have some level of intelligence but little in the way of culture, lying in wait in wet caves along underground rivers to snare passers-by and drain them of their blood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leech-hides and leech-glass (their slashers, cut right from their hands) are very valuable. Leech-hide dustcoats count as &lt;strong&gt;hide armor&lt;/strong&gt; and convey their benefit in &lt;strong&gt;halving sharp and fire damage.&lt;/strong&gt; Leech-glass weapons have the &lt;strong&gt;spike&lt;/strong&gt; property in addition to their normal ones, though it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to fashion a leech-glass blade into anything larger than a knife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slashers:&lt;/strong&gt; Rock leech slashers are made of preternaturally sharp glasslike material, shot through with thousands of narrow channels that drain blood from their victims and feed it directly back into their systems. Slashers are &lt;strong&gt;light spike melee weapons&lt;/strong&gt; that deal &lt;strong&gt;1d6&lt;/strong&gt; base damage and heal the leech for damage dealt. A rock leech doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to eat if it has healed at least 1 HP through slasher damage that day. This can be hazardous if used to drain the blood of a creature suffering from poison or a malady, etc. Slashers aren&amp;rsquo;t much good for grasping or fiddling, add &lt;strong&gt;2 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; to rolls involving fine manual dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leechsense:&lt;/strong&gt; Rock leeches are blind, but their sensitivity to sound and smell allow them to hunt very well in the darkness. They take no penalties for being blind in melee combat, but must locate prey through other senses outside of melee range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riverine:&lt;/strong&gt; You&amp;rsquo;re amphibious and have a &lt;strong&gt;swim&lt;/strong&gt; speed. Saltwater (or touching a large volume of salt in general) leeches (ha, ha) the water right out of your blood, dealing you 1 damage per round of exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leech Hide:&lt;/strong&gt; A rock leech&amp;rsquo;s slick, tough hide provides natural armor as scale (+4 AC) and halves damage taken from sharp things and fire. It also blends in with dark stone, adding &lt;strong&gt;4 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; to rolls made to notice them while hiding.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Fast Movement:&lt;/strong&gt; Rock leeches are fast-moving predators, with a +4 bonus to initiative and 40&amp;rsquo; land speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;rock-lampreys&#34;&gt;Rock Lampreys &lt;a href=&#34;#rock-lampreys&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 2 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 13 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 7 (lithodermis, as plate) &lt;strong&gt;Half&lt;/strong&gt; damage from physical sources and fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +0 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&amp;rsquo; **Swim **30&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **14 +2 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 6 -2 **Charisma **12 +1&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 14 melee slashers 1d6+2 spike, heals for damage dealt&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Hadeal, Serumic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rock lampreys are a more muscular, hardier breed of rock leech, often acting as the &amp;lsquo;alpha&amp;rsquo; of rock leech hunting groups. Some who have delved deep under the Mountain tell nightmarish tales of entire rock lamprey villages far below the earth. We hope those stories are not reliable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crafting armor out of rock lamprey lithodermis is, unfortunately, nearly impossible—it brittles and cracks soon after one is skinned. If one managed to do so somehow, it would be formidable protection indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Slashers:&lt;/strong&gt; As rock leech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leechsense:&lt;/strong&gt; As rock leech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Riverine:&lt;/strong&gt; As rock leech.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Lithodermis: **A rock lamprey&amp;rsquo;s hide is hard and knobbed over with stony growths, granting it armor as plate (+7 AC) and halving damage taken from all physical trauma (including falling) as well as fire. It also blends in with dark stone, adding &lt;strong&gt;4 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; to rolls made to notice them while hiding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;leech-stalkers-playing-a-rock-leech&#34;&gt;Leech-Stalkers (Playing a Rock Leech) &lt;a href=&#34;#leech-stalkers-playing-a-rock-leech&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can play a rock leech if your party befriends the rock leeches. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how one would befriend the rock leeches, and I&amp;rsquo;m even less sure that it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea to do so even if you do figure out how, but hey. The option is there. Pick a race. Rock leeches get &lt;strong&gt;Leech Hide, Fast Movement,&lt;/strong&gt; and reroll &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity.&lt;/strong&gt; Rock lampreys get &lt;strong&gt;Lithodermis&lt;/strong&gt; and reroll &lt;strong&gt;Strength.&lt;/strong&gt; Both races get &lt;strong&gt;Slashers, Leechsense,&lt;/strong&gt; **Riverine, **and reroll &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence,&lt;/strong&gt; taking the lower result, then &lt;strong&gt;subtract 2.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t get anything at first level. Being a leech is enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leech Dance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At second level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can perform a swaying dance as an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt; to hypnotize your prey. If they&amp;rsquo;re looking at you, they roll **Intelligence **or are &lt;strong&gt;stunned&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;1 round.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hunting Sense&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At second level,&lt;/strong&gt; your leech-sense expands to give you a clear mental picture of the surrounding 10 feet. You don&amp;rsquo;t count as blind when interacting with things within that range. You still can&amp;rsquo;t see color or read printed text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; it expands again to 30 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; it expands finally to 60 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bloodletting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; wounds caused by your slashers bleed for &lt;strong&gt;1 damage&lt;/strong&gt; **per round **until bandaged or cauterized due to anticoagulant gel coating the blades. This stacks if you hit something multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Leech Ambush&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At third level,&lt;/strong&gt; your skin blends in even more perfectly with the rock. As long as you&amp;rsquo;re in dim or no light, rocky terrain, and not being actively observed, you can disappear completely. You can&amp;rsquo;t be seen again until you move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cliff Leech&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; you can scale stone walls as easily as you walk or swim. Gain a &lt;strong&gt;climb&lt;/strong&gt; speed equal to your land speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crashers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;At fourth level,&lt;/strong&gt; your slashers develop into &lt;strong&gt;crashers,&lt;/strong&gt; gigantic tangles of broken leech-glass surrounding your fists like morningstar heads. These are &lt;strong&gt;light spike melee weapons&lt;/strong&gt; that deal &lt;strong&gt;2d6&lt;/strong&gt; base damage, with all the other properties of your slashers. Add &lt;strong&gt;4 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; to rolls involving fine manual dexterity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ratmen&#34;&gt;Ratmen &lt;a href=&#34;#ratmen&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;These have a &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/05/mountain-rat-warrens-dungeon.html&#34;&gt;dungeon&lt;/a&gt; now!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 6 -2 **Charisma **6 -2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 9 melee ratman poke-stick 1d4-2 improvised reach + roll Strength or contract Ratspite&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;DEX Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 12 melee ratman shiv 1d2+1 improvised close quarter throatcutter&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Chew and Decay, poorly, but they understand every language&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt; 50% chance of ratman poke-stick (medium improvised reach 1d4) or shiv (light improvised close quarter throatcutter 1d2), something else both stupid and poorly-conceived, maybe a shiny pebble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ratmen are little things that live anywhere there is dark. They can be found under the Mountain, but some live in the sewers and cellars of civilized towns on it as well. They breed like, well, rats. They are at war with the bat men. They have always been at war with the bat men. They are much weaker than the bat men, but there are so many more of them. They are winning the war. They have never lost a war. It is impossible to win a war against the ratmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rat Ingenuity:&lt;/strong&gt; Ratmen can build anything out of anything. It won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily &lt;em&gt;work&lt;/em&gt;, but they can &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ratsight:&lt;/strong&gt; Ratmen can see as well in dim light as humans can see in sunlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photophobia:&lt;/strong&gt; Ratmen roll **Charisma **to enter areas of bright light, or again if anyone holding a light source spends an &lt;strong&gt;action&lt;/strong&gt; to brandish it threateningly. If they fail, they run screeching and hollering to its edge and lurk there. They can try again once every minute. Ratmen who are forced into bright light despite a failed roll are helpless; they throw down their weapon, piss themselves, curl up into a ball, and sob uncontrollably (at least until an opportunity for escape presents itself). Under no circumstances will they approach within 60&amp;rsquo; of a large light source (such as a bonfire, or a pile of burning furniture). They dislike attacking lightbearers in melee, and will only attack them if no other attractive options present themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t play a ratman, but you can probably play &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-class-many-goblins.html&#34;&gt;many ratmen&lt;/a&gt;. Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=Gu9e4wZc&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; for ratman names.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My goblins are people, so these are my goblins. These are the ones that do all the &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/11/d8-shitty-goblin-weapons.html&#34;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/05/wtf-are-those-goblins-doing.html&#34;&gt;goblin&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2019/10/d7-goblintown-arena-fights.html&#34;&gt;shit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Blue Heretics hate this shit. Hierarchy? Theology?? In the days when the g_ds still deigned to speak with us there was no Church. Maybe if the world wasn&amp;rsquo;t filled with &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2019/10/blessed-of-gd-class-cleric.html&#34;&gt;cowards&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/03/general-manufacturing-class-wizard.html&#34;&gt;sluts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2019/12/oberon-and-titania-class-warlock-secret.html&#34;&gt;other products of church-ery&lt;/a&gt;, the g_ds would still be around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;rsquo;re a follower of the Blue Heresy and you&amp;rsquo;re _damned proud of it._Let the priests in their cathedrals rail against you, for here at the edge of the world you are beyond the pathetic reach of their Church. You oil your body and wear your mask proudly, for it marks you as one who is—above all else—&lt;strong&gt;not afraid.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;https://tao-dnd.blogspot.com/2012/11/how-to-play-cleric.html&#34;&gt;This is how you should play every character with a link to the divine, but it&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; how you should play an oiled paladin.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Tenets of the Blue Heretics, in order of importance.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never give in to cowardice.&lt;/strong&gt; You can retreat from a fight, but only if you make it clear to whatever you are retreating from that you could destroy them but are &lt;em&gt;simply choosing not to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never let yourself be governed by another. If you do something for someone, it is because &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; wish to, not because you were commanded. Disobey direct orders, or rationalize them as actually &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; idea and perform them with your own flair.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be disrespectful, drink in public, fraternize with prostitutes and tax collectors, throw garbage at rich people. If someone tells you to do these things, immediately become super polite and bougie just to screw with them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don&amp;rsquo;t carry more of anything than you need. Share your booze, food and money with the beggars of the street.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communicate through a medium-to-high yell at all times, especially when talking to people who can&amp;rsquo;t beat you up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you take off your mask or break a tenet, you lose all your &lt;strong&gt;DD&lt;/strong&gt; and can&amp;rsquo;t use any Oiled Paladin class features except &lt;strong&gt;oiled&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;extra attack per round&lt;/strong&gt; until you put your mask back on &lt;strong&gt;and&lt;/strong&gt; do at least three of: Get good and drunk, yell at someone, start a fight that could have been avoided, eat a solid meal, get a good night&amp;rsquo;s sleep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For every template of this class you have, you gain &lt;strong&gt;+1 HRTS or SAVE&lt;/strong&gt; (your choice at each template). You use the &lt;strong&gt;specialist&lt;/strong&gt; to-hit progression, increasing by &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; at templates &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;D.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starting Items:&lt;/strong&gt; A blue mask (see image), simple but revealing workman&amp;rsquo;s clothing (probably jorts and a cropped denim jacket), hatchet and hammer (both light weapons), sheath of 10 eighteen-inch iron spike nails, skin of scented oil, pint flask of hard liquor, and one piece of gear rolled randomly from the list at the end. You can&amp;rsquo;t fumble with blunt or chopping weapons, like cudgels, maces, staves, axes, hammers, and machetes. You can&amp;rsquo;t wear armor unless you have training or templates in another class that lets you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Mockery and Invective, 2. Labor, 3. Posturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Defiance, Oiled, +1 DD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Resolute Fury, +1 DD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C:&lt;/strong&gt; Harangue, Extra Attack Per Round, +1 DD&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Absolute Resolve, From Hell&amp;rsquo;s Heart, +1 DD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Defiance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have a pool of &lt;strong&gt;Defiance Dice,&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;DD,&lt;/strong&gt; which are d4s equal to the number of oiled paladin templates you have. You can roll any number of these when you roll a d20, and add them to the result. &lt;strong&gt;DD&lt;/strong&gt; that come up a result less than or equal to the number of &lt;strong&gt;DD&lt;/strong&gt; you rolled are &lt;strong&gt;expended&lt;/strong&gt; until you get a good long rest, otherwise they return to your pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Oiled&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While conscious, oiled up, and wearing your mask, you are protected as if by **clothing appropriate to the environment **and &lt;strong&gt;leather&lt;/strong&gt; armor. If you receive training or templates in a class that lets you wear better armor you can do so, but you consider it at least a slight indignity and it won&amp;rsquo;t stack, you just take the higher AC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Resolute Fury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can roll and &lt;strong&gt;expend&lt;/strong&gt; any number of &lt;strong&gt;DD&lt;/strong&gt; to enter a resolute fury for &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes, gaining a &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus to all rolls related to &lt;strong&gt;mobility or resistance,&lt;/strong&gt; causing your fists and feet to count as &lt;strong&gt;light&lt;/strong&gt; weapons that deal an additional &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt; damage, and rendering you &lt;strong&gt;immune to pain, fear, and other negative mind-affecting abilities&lt;/strong&gt; for the duration. While in a fury, you must roll &lt;strong&gt;SKLL&lt;/strong&gt; to avoid doing things that are &lt;strong&gt;bold, heroic, and utterly foolhardy,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;ignore [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] slots of exhaustion&lt;/strong&gt; but &lt;strong&gt;gain [&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;lowest&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] slots of exhaustion&lt;/strong&gt; after your fury ends. You can attempt to roll &lt;strong&gt;SKLL&lt;/strong&gt; once per round without spending an action to end your fury before its duration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Harangue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can roll and &lt;strong&gt;expend&lt;/strong&gt; any number of &lt;strong&gt;DD&lt;/strong&gt; to spew a stream of inspiring invective for &lt;strong&gt;[best]&lt;/strong&gt; minutes. Allies that can hear you gain a &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt; bonus on rolls against &lt;strong&gt;fear or intimidation&lt;/strong&gt; and ignore &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;best&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;] damage from each attack&lt;/strong&gt; for the duration, and enemies that can hear you must check &lt;strong&gt;Morale&lt;/strong&gt; when the haranguing starts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Absolute Resolve&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you have at least one &lt;strong&gt;DD,&lt;/strong&gt; you can &lt;strong&gt;roll and expend all DD you currently have&lt;/strong&gt; to do one thing that&amp;rsquo;s probably impossible but not completely out of the question to save your own life or the life of one of your party members. Break out of unbreakable bonds, end up clinging to the cliff face thirty meters down after a nasty fall, step into the way of a killing blow meant for your ally, et cetera. Gain &lt;strong&gt;[lowest]&lt;/strong&gt; slots of exhaustion after the effect resolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: From Hell&amp;rsquo;s Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When an attack drops you to &lt;strong&gt;0 or lower HP,&lt;/strong&gt; you get a &lt;strong&gt;free attack&lt;/strong&gt; against whatever made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;gear&#34;&gt;Gear &lt;a href=&#34;#gear&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Workman&amp;rsquo;s rucksack. Plenty of hooks and loops and pockets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kukri. Heavy axe-like machete/dagger intended for chopping. Medium weapon that takes up space like a light weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tin of smoked tea and insulated thermos. Thermos keeps temperature for most of a day. 1 slot each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;100&amp;rsquo; rope and rope-clips. 2 slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tongs. Counts as light weapon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Flask of expensive brandy. By far the nicest anyone you meet will have ever had, unless they&amp;rsquo;re fabulously rich, and even then they&amp;rsquo;ll admit it&amp;rsquo;s pretty good. 1/3rd of a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overengineered buckler with a lantern hook and plenty of spikes. Light weapon, +1 AC, can hold a lantern, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightweight wok. Very well designed, could serve as a light shield if you put straps on it, or a sled or a bucket or something. Only takes up 1 slot as long as it&amp;rsquo;s tied down properly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sturdy pair of leather gloves. Nearly fireproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20 hand-rolled cigarillos. Roll a d20 per cigarillo when smoked, you keep them all mixed together, it&amp;rsquo;s more exciting that way: 1-10 tobacco, 11-19 mild psychedelic, 20 explodes (both literally and mechanically) for 1d6 damage to the smoker per 20 rolled with no save. 1/3rd of a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Small statue of a cat covered with gold leaf. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very nice silk brocade cloak and braided chain to affix it. +1 on reaction rolls. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 ornately carved jade knives. Not especially effective as weapons. 1 slot total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottle of liquid soap, useful for getting all the old oil off you, as antifreeze, for cleaning just about anything, greasing something, etc. 1/3rd of a slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trick ring containing one dose of extremely deadly poison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Big bowl-shaped straw hat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gigantic wooden collar. Bite ring holds it in place, can&amp;rsquo;t talk while wearing it. +1 AC, 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calligraphy set. Several colors of ink, pens, brushes, et cetera. 1 slot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 javelins. Light weapons, 1 slot total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something weird. Roll 1d4:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skeleton key. Made of bone, capped with a mouse skull, whispers in the dark. Can break off in any lock to unlock it, once closed that container can never be unlocked again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rusted iron crossbow bolt. Stained with old blood and always warm. If embedded in flesh, the target flies into a rage and won&amp;rsquo;t stop fighting until subdued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crude map scratched on a piece of tree bark. Always depicts the surrounding 444&amp;rsquo;, but difficult to navigate by since it doesn&amp;rsquo;t compress distances logically, highlights terrain features of little import, and sometimes doesn&amp;rsquo;t show ones of great import.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrap of a torn banner. Shows the symbol of whatever organization the viewer is most afraid of. When you look at it, it&amp;rsquo;s solid black, of course—you&amp;rsquo;re not afraid of anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>The Tao of GLOG</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/the-tao-of-glog.html</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:37:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/the-tao-of-glog.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--JqJXvbc8h8/XwJOoBTilVI/AAAAAAAApi4/mQEzCXc_kZYqW8pIFoaDJrqhYXLtf3LDwCK4BGAsYHg/s530/Annotation%2B2020-07-05%2B150437.png&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--JqJXvbc8h8/XwJOoBTilVI/AAAAAAAApi4/mQEzCXc_kZYqW8pIFoaDJrqhYXLtf3LDwCK4BGAsYHg/s320/Annotation%2B2020-07-05%2B150437.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m gonna print this out and frame it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GLOG that can be written is not the true GLOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GLOG is empty; when utilized, it is not filled up. So deep! It seems to be the source of all things. It blunts the sharpness, unravels the knots, dims the glare, mixes the dusts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The highest goodness resembles water. Water greatly benefits myriad things without contention, it stays in places that people dislike. Therefore it is similar to the GLOG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GLOG is like a flood; it can flow to the left or to the right; the myriad things depend on it for life, but it never stops; it achieves its work, but does not take credit; it clothes and feeds myriad things, but does not rule over them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GLOG that is spoken out of the mouth is bland and without flavor. Look at it, it cannot be seen; listen to it, it cannot be heard; use it, it cannot be exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The GLOG is constant in non-action, yet there is nothing it does not do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When mechanics are lackluster, the players are simple and honest. When mechanics are scrutinizing, the players are shrewd and crafty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;~&lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Lao Tzu&lt;/a&gt;, probably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;OSR discord user deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt; and I have been passing the same damn edited Tao quote back and forth so I figured it was time to mine the text for a few more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bestiary: A is for Angel</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-is-for-angel.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 15 Apr 2020 19:06:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/bestiary-is-for-angel.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;An effort to force myself to finish the Bestiary for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;Mountain at the End of the World.&lt;/a&gt; Stats are for &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;the GROG&lt;/a&gt;, so base AC is 0 ascending and base attack is 10 + level ascending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;angels&#34;&gt;Angels &lt;a href=&#34;#angels&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Angels are spirits of sun and fire. Most angels are comprised of two parts; the divine soul—a fire elemental—and the celestial body, often an armature or suit of blessed armor but sometimes a device of more sophisticated and less explicable holiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No form of angel is ever damaged by fire, either consecrated or natural.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b6VON0BKK9A/Xpe0HupzgzI/AAAAAAAApBw/jcVA-bL-p9cQ64c2konWj08Wq3pa0WEFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/dogspider.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-b6VON0BKK9A/Xpe0HupzgzI/AAAAAAAApBw/jcVA-bL-p9cQ64c2konWj08Wq3pa0WEFwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/dogspider.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;pretend it&amp;rsquo;s a toy cathedral or something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;dog-spider&#34;&gt;Dog-Spider &lt;a href=&#34;#dog-spider&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Small &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +4 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Climb&lt;/strong&gt; 30&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 6 -2 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 11 melee ivory teeth 1d6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Angelfire, Arqot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs are sometimes held to be angels, but not all dogs and especially not all dogmen are close to and of the sun. Dogs-spider are not true angels either, born in crypts as others of their specii, but grown fat on the flesh of the holy dead. They consume all of their benevolence and wisdom and take some measure of it into themselves, leaving the corpse-saints ragged and malicious in their tombs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs-spider have furnaces for hearts and smoke for blood and they need coal or bone or ash or oil or soot or corpseflesh to stoke their flames. They have the voice of a screaming choir emitted in short, sharp barks, and four long, multiply-jointed legs that terminate in iron spikes. Their canine faces (not masks, no) are carved from ivory and sanctified bone, and if pulled off reveal their brains like a thousand knotted worms all alight with holy fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dog-spider bites are not venomous, but their drool can heal physical traumas if smeared across the wound or bruise (heals 1d6 damage, loses potency when the dog-spider dies). They can extrude silk, stronger than any rope and imbued with divine power, but the method by which they do so is extremely gross.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs-spider want to heal the sick, protect the downtrodden, and teach the inquisitive, but also want to chase sticks and burn things and eat and shit and roll around in the ashes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;which orbs of light are good and which ones are bad? who knows&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;lantern-archon&#34;&gt;Lantern Archon &lt;a href=&#34;#lantern-archon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 1 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Tiny &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 3 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +3 &lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt; 60&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **-- &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 8 -1 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 17 +3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DEX Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 10 60&amp;rsquo; range light ray 1d6 holy fire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Angelfire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lanterns archon are commonly confused with torches sprite and share many traits, but where a torch sprite is created from a once-living soul, a lantern archon is a true angelic being (albeit the least among them). They are generally helpful, if you can communicate with them. If you somehow acquire a guardian angel, it&amp;rsquo;s probably one of these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body of Light:&lt;/strong&gt; Lanterns archon take no physical damage from weapons. They can be extinguished by anything that would extinguish a brazier-sized fire; a bucket of water or sand, a fireproof blanket, et cetera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qJEUyt0IeZE/Xpe2d4HFVOI/AAAAAAAApCI/GGJm_aH6bV4t7WXX462mF4-SNURKFkKMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/tumblr_mjkfkpnkud1rtdsh3o1_1280.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qJEUyt0IeZE/Xpe2d4HFVOI/AAAAAAAApCI/GGJm_aH6bV4t7WXX462mF4-SNURKFkKMwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/tumblr_mjkfkpnkud1rtdsh3o1_1280.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;they don&amp;rsquo;t have to be this impressive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;fire-elemental&#34;&gt;Fire Elemental &lt;a href=&#34;#fire-elemental&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m not writing stats for these just use something else but it&amp;rsquo;s made out of fire now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 16 +3 minimum&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Angelfire, plus Common, Ember, and Old Tongue if it&amp;rsquo;s older&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fires elemental are the core truth of an angel, the same way that a person would have a soul. They manifest physically as a mass of fire or force, which can be of any form as they will. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smaller and younger fires elemental often manifest in humanoid or doglike shapes, and move with the speed of flame racing up a strip of paper. Bigger and older ones shift through strange and indescribable forms that scratch at half-buried ancestral memories, shades of great adversaries past. They move ponderously, but strike with the force of an explosion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire Magic:&lt;/strong&gt; Fires elemental can cast one or more of &lt;em&gt;burning hands&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fireball&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;firebolt&lt;/em&gt; and/or &lt;em&gt;wall of fire&lt;/em&gt; as a white mage of the same level. Bigger and older fire elementals can cast more spells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Body of Fire:&lt;/strong&gt; Any creature touching a fire elemental or attacking it with a melee weapon takes 1d6 holy fire damage. Bigger and older fire elementals also cause 1d6 holy fire damage per round to things that end their turn next to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yNAWNp-DPsc/Xpe3duZmy6I/AAAAAAAApCU/Npd3UfOERe0IO9FGEsLCU3n70rmDJZK6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/tomas-norambuena-hound-archon.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yNAWNp-DPsc/Xpe3duZmy6I/AAAAAAAApCU/Npd3UfOERe0IO9FGEsLCU3n70rmDJZK6QCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/tomas-norambuena-hound-archon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;surprisingly hard to find a good hound archon image anyway imagine this but dead and burning&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;hound-archon-dog-golem-sword-archon&#34;&gt;Hound Archon (Dog-Golem, Sword Archon) &lt;a href=&#34;#hound-archon-dog-golem-sword-archon&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 4 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 26 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Medium &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 6 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +4 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Strength **15 +2 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 14 +2 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; 10 +0 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 15 +2&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 16 melee angelic greatsword 2d8+3 (+1 and ignores 1 AC vs humanoids)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Angelfire, Common, Ember, Old Tongue, Arqot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hounds archon are one of the lesser creations of the angels, born when they need soldiers. They are formed from the skin of a dogman stretched over an armature of brass and iron, packed with coals, and animated by a lesser fire elemental or lantern archon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hounds archon are armed with iron greatswords and frequently wear armor to supplement their natural resistance to blows. A hound archon in half-plate has &lt;strong&gt;AC 12&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Speed 20&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Metal Bones:&lt;/strong&gt; Hounds archon have +2 AC on account of their metal skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ev7fu0mJLOQ/Xpe6sV9woSI/AAAAAAAApCo/pjsfcG-Obs0cLgy2MoSkE6vsmKRydG2jACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/5cfe71e84d34071f7d78f657_TheTorah.com%25252FEzekiel-Vision.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ev7fu0mJLOQ/Xpe6sV9woSI/AAAAAAAApCo/pjsfcG-Obs0cLgy2MoSkE6vsmKRydG2jACLcBGAsYHQ/s400/5cfe71e84d34071f7d78f657_TheTorah.com%25252FEzekiel-Vision.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;this picture is for both kinds of real angels&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;ophan-wheel-chariot-throne&#34;&gt;Ophan (Wheel, Chariot, Throne) &lt;a href=&#34;#ophan-wheel-chariot-throne&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arnold already did this really well so just &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2015/07/angels.html&#34;&gt;use his&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; Angelfire, Common, Ember, Old Tongue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ophanim, also known as Wheels, Chariots, or Thrones, are a lower form of “true” angel. Manifested as a whirling collection of between one and six eye-studded golden wheels wreathed in holy fire; ghostly wings of light might be visible in and around the angel’s body. Ophanim are tasked with judging mortal souls, and they tend to be single-minded in this goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;seraph-archangel-power&#34;&gt;Seraph (Archangel, Power) &lt;a href=&#34;#seraph-archangel-power&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;HD&lt;/strong&gt; 7 &lt;strong&gt;HP&lt;/strong&gt; 87 &lt;strong&gt;Size&lt;/strong&gt; Large &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; 10&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Init&lt;/strong&gt; +10 &lt;strong&gt;Speed&lt;/strong&gt; 30&amp;rsquo; &lt;strong&gt;Fly&lt;/strong&gt; 60&#39;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; 27 +8 &lt;strong&gt;Dexterity&lt;/strong&gt; 19 +4 &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Intelligence **19 +4 &lt;strong&gt;Wisdom&lt;/strong&gt; 23 +6&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;STR Attack&lt;/strong&gt; 25 melee angelic greatsword 2d8+8 + 3d6 holy fire (held in one hand)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speaks&lt;/strong&gt; All languages (gift of tongues)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seraphim are at the highest level in the angelic hierarchy, the trusted hands of the sun. Each is unique, granted its own set of powers and trusted with a certain domain of the sun’s concerns to look after. Most Seraphim, at least those which mortal eyes can bear to look upon, have the appearance of a confluence of wings, arms, hands, and eyes. They also sometimes appear as towering six-winged humanoid figures with golden skin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine Innocence:&lt;/strong&gt; Any creature that can see the Seraph and attempts to attack it must roll Wisdom to do so. This ability only functions while the Seraph is at full HP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Divine Power:&lt;/strong&gt; Seraphim can cast spells as a white mage of the same level. Their MD are never expended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;1d20-domains-archangelic&#34;&gt;1d20 Domains Archangelic &lt;a href=&#34;#1d20-domains-archangelic&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;War.&lt;/strong&gt; Carries a gleaming shield granting a +7 AC and allowing it to reflect targeted spells that are resisted by it against a target of its choice, suffering none of the effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fate.&lt;/strong&gt; While in the angel’s presence, rolls of 7 count as natural 20s, and rolls of 4 or 13 count as natural 1s. Only the positive side of this ability affects angels. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dawn.&lt;/strong&gt; The angel shines like the sun, casting bright light in an unlimited radius. Looking at it blinds sighted creatures for 1d6 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fire.&lt;/strong&gt; The angel is surrounded by a nimbus of intense flame, dealing 6d6 holy fire damage to all creatures that enter or begin their turn in a 10-foot radius around it. Things that touch it directly and aren’t immune to holy fire are immediately destroyed. The angel leaves footprints of molten earth where it walks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom.&lt;/strong&gt; The angel automatically succeeds at Wisdom rolls, and can make any rolls associated with actions before deciding whether or not to take them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanctuary.&lt;/strong&gt; Combat, attack rolls, and damage (except BATTLEFIRE) are impossible in the angel’s presence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Death.&lt;/strong&gt; Living creatures that touch the angel roll Strength or die. Creatures that succeed are immune to death until dawn the next day. Plants and wood are destroyed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light.&lt;/strong&gt; Creatures and objects that touch the angel are permanently enchanted to glow like a torch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mercy.&lt;/strong&gt; No creature in the angel’s presence can feel pain.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wrath.&lt;/strong&gt; Creatures that begin their turn in the angel’s presence roll Wisdom or attack something. If there are no targets within range of any of their attacks, they target themselves.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grace.&lt;/strong&gt; Attacks against the angel automatically miss, and it takes no damage from effects that allow a Dexterity roll for partial effect.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purity.&lt;/strong&gt; Creatures in the angel’s presence are cured of any poisons, diseases, drug effects, curses, or other maladies, and can&amp;rsquo;t be affected by any of those so long as they remain in its presence. They can still be wounded, catch fire, fall unconscious, and die.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salvation.&lt;/strong&gt; Creatures that die in the angel’s presence disappear in a cloud of golden sparks, and reawaken the next day at dawn in the last place they rested, with full HP. Their equipment stays where they fell, and they have vivid white scars showing the manner of their demise.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retribution.&lt;/strong&gt; Any creature damaging the angel immediately takes the same damage. If the damage was caused by a weapon, that weapon also gains a notch. Indirect damage (causing a large object to fall on the angel, et cetera) doesn&amp;rsquo;t cause damage to the instigator, but ranged attacks and attack spells do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jubilation.&lt;/strong&gt; All creatures within a 70 foot radius of the angel are filled with divine confidence, immune to fear effects, and count all their stats as 7 higher for d20 rolls.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condemnation.&lt;/strong&gt; At the beginning of each of the angel’s turns, it selects one target that it can see to be the target of its condemnation. Until the beginning of its next turn, all attacks against that target that hit are critical hits. The angel will always select the target it believes to be most wicked and evil.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Silence.&lt;/strong&gt; Nothing in the angel’s presence makes any sound at all. Spellcasting and speech are impossible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Industry.&lt;/strong&gt; In the angel’s presence, workers’ contributions to a work or process are multiplied tenfold.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Devastation.&lt;/strong&gt; A 70 foot radius around the angel is continually aflame, dealing 1d6 holy fire damage to all who enter or begin their turn within the area. Within the radius, buildings crumble and vegetation is burned to the ground. Nothing can grow or be built there for at least a decade.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Containment.&lt;/strong&gt; The angel is accompanied by a solid orb of sunlight 10 feet in diameter, which floats perpetually above its head. Any creature the angel touches rolls Wisdom or collapses as its soul is instantaneously and permanently confined to the orb. The orb has 77 HP, and destroying it will return the souls to their bodies if the bodies still exist. It contains many souls already.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 21:45:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-fight-book-techniques-for-fighters.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are some &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2019/11/ten-of-swords-class-fighter-again.html&#34;&gt;Techniques&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A widely syncretic style developed in gladiatorial arenas. An ex-gladiator could teach you these techniques if you manage to find one that isn&amp;rsquo;t dead; failing that, a veteran soldier might know it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hoplomachus.&lt;/strong&gt; When you make a &lt;strong&gt;charge&lt;/strong&gt; attack while wielding a shield, your opponent rolls &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; or is &lt;strong&gt;stunned&lt;/strong&gt; for &lt;strong&gt;1 round.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secutor.&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t be effectively &lt;strong&gt;entangled.&lt;/strong&gt; Opponents trying to &lt;strong&gt;grapple&lt;/strong&gt; you have &lt;strong&gt;+4 difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on their attempts, and you &lt;strong&gt;ignore 4 points of difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; on your attempts to escape from a &lt;strong&gt;grapple.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dimachaerus.&lt;/strong&gt; When wielding two weapons, you have &lt;strong&gt;+1 AC&lt;/strong&gt; and reduce the &lt;strong&gt;difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; for making multiple attacks to &lt;strong&gt;+1 per attack made.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Retiarius.&lt;/strong&gt; You can use a net or lasso to make &lt;strong&gt;grapple&lt;/strong&gt; attempts at a range of up to 15 feet. This requires both hands, but does not require you to let go of the net or lasso. If you succeed, your opponent is dragged adjacent to you (causing &lt;strong&gt;free attacks&lt;/strong&gt; as normal) but you cannot &lt;strong&gt;throw&lt;/strong&gt; them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pan Makon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A bare-handed or cestus and wrestling style used in athletic competitions, renowned for its brutality. Teachers are easy enough to find, but charge a high price for their instruction. It&amp;rsquo;s a business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gasteran.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Once per round,&lt;/strong&gt; you can deliver a swift straight-leg kick to your opponent&amp;rsquo;s stomach in an attempt to knock them off-balance. Roll opposed &lt;strong&gt;Strength.&lt;/strong&gt; If you succeed, your opponent is knocked &lt;strong&gt;prone;&lt;/strong&gt; if you fail, your opponent gets a &lt;strong&gt;free attack&lt;/strong&gt; that can only be used to &lt;strong&gt;trip&lt;/strong&gt; you with a &lt;strong&gt;combat maneuver&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ano.&lt;/strong&gt; Your unarmed attacks deal &lt;strong&gt;one additional die of damage.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Kato.&lt;/strong&gt; Count your &lt;strong&gt;Strength&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;2 higher&lt;/strong&gt; for all purposes related to &lt;strong&gt;grappling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hypsos.&lt;/strong&gt; You can &lt;strong&gt;throw&lt;/strong&gt; opponents up to three times your height in distance, rather than just your height. If they collide with something, both they and it take &lt;strong&gt;3d6 damage minus one die for each 5 feet they have traveled, with a Dexterity roll for half.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hauptstokke&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An functional style focusing on the longsword. More likely to be learned from a grizzled veteran than a traveling swordmaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zornhau.&lt;/strong&gt; If your first attack against a target with a heavy warblade hits, &lt;strong&gt;ignore AC&lt;/strong&gt; against that target for the rest of the combat.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Huten.&lt;/strong&gt; While &lt;strong&gt;parrying&lt;/strong&gt; with a heavy warblade, you have &lt;strong&gt;+2 additional AC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mutieren.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Once per round,&lt;/strong&gt; when you hit your target&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;AC&lt;/strong&gt; with a heavy warblade you can immediately make a &lt;strong&gt;free attack&lt;/strong&gt; against them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mordstreich.&lt;/strong&gt; When wielding a heavy warblade and wearing gauntlets, you can switch between treating it as a &lt;strong&gt;greathammer (heavy crushing headsplitter, 2d6),&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;estoc (heavy spike warblade, 1d10),&lt;/strong&gt; or as normal depending on whatever is most advantageous at the moment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seven Swords&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An elaborate, graceful, and highly technical fencing style. Favored by noble duelists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prudentia.&lt;/strong&gt; While your weapon is drawn, you can add your &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;strong&gt;initiative.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Celeritas.&lt;/strong&gt; While holding a light or finesse weapon in your main hand and nothing in at least one off hand, you can add your &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;strong&gt;AC.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audatia.&lt;/strong&gt; When attempting to &lt;strong&gt;intimidate,&lt;/strong&gt; you can apply your &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;as well as&lt;/em&gt; any other &lt;strong&gt;modifier&lt;/strong&gt; as &lt;strong&gt;difficulty&lt;/strong&gt; to your opponents&amp;rsquo; **Charisma **roll(s). When you successfully &lt;strong&gt;intimidate&lt;/strong&gt; someone, you can choose to have them fly into a rage and attack you in place of the normal effects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortitudo.&lt;/strong&gt; You can choose to roll &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; in place of **Charisma **to resist any effects that normally allow a **Charisma **roll. While &lt;strong&gt;parrying,&lt;/strong&gt; you can apply the &lt;strong&gt;bonus AC from parrying&lt;/strong&gt; to your &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; for the purpose of this ability. Yes, this means you can parry spells, insults, and general conversation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Batto-Ryu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A defensive style emphasizing parries, guards, and quick-drawing. Known primarily by sword-monks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saya.&lt;/strong&gt; While you have at least two hands free, you can draw a weapon from  your &lt;strong&gt;fast inventory&lt;/strong&gt; without an &lt;strong&gt;action.&lt;/strong&gt; You can also resheathe a weapon held in your main hand without an &lt;strong&gt;action,&lt;/strong&gt; as long as you have at least one hand free. It is customary for practitioners to resheathe their sword after every strike.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seiza.&lt;/strong&gt; You can stand up from a prone, sitting, kneeling, or any other position without a &lt;strong&gt;move action.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iai.&lt;/strong&gt; While you have at least two hands free and you have a sheathed light or finesse warblade in your fast inventory, you never count as &lt;strong&gt;surprised&lt;/strong&gt; and can &lt;strong&gt;parry&lt;/strong&gt; (and make **free attacks) **as if you were holding your weapon in your main hand.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Giri.&lt;/strong&gt; When you draw a light or finesse warblade and make a single attack with it in the same round, you &lt;strong&gt;ignore your target&amp;rsquo;s AC&lt;/strong&gt; as if they were &lt;strong&gt;surprised.&lt;/strong&gt; You can&amp;rsquo;t make more than one attack on your turn if you use this ability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Putu&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A functional style that emphasizes battlefield combat, and includes focuses on areas of warfare that don&amp;rsquo;t relate directly to fighting as well. Practitioners hold that it was taught to its originator, a fallen member of the warrior nobility, by a demon. Could be learned from a veteran commander, a militant lord, or possibly a demon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impertinence.&lt;/strong&gt; Your &lt;strong&gt;Attack&lt;/strong&gt; increases by &lt;strong&gt;+1,&lt;/strong&gt; but this isn&amp;rsquo;t a fighting technique—it&amp;rsquo;s a teaching technique. Given a week of training (8 hours/day), you can teach anyone with half a brain enough principles of swordplay to give &lt;em&gt;them&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;+1 Attack, up to your Attack.&lt;/strong&gt; If they have less than half a brain, it takes two weeks. You can teach multiple students at a time, up to the lower of your &lt;strong&gt;Intelligence&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Charisma.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Altercation.&lt;/strong&gt; When fighting something of a lower level than you, you deal &lt;strong&gt;extra damage equal to your level.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Disrepute.&lt;/strong&gt; You didn&amp;rsquo;t just train at fighting. Gain &lt;strong&gt;skill&lt;/strong&gt; with a complex game of your choice, like Go or Mahjong. Whenever you spend a week travelling with soldiers, sailors, or others of similar profession, roll your &lt;strong&gt;HD.&lt;/strong&gt; You gain that many &lt;strong&gt;gold&lt;/strong&gt; pieces worth of miscellaneous coins, gems, jewelry, and IOUs. If any of the dice roll their maximum value, discard them—someone was broke, couldn&amp;rsquo;t pay you, and now owes you a serious favor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crossed Swords.&lt;/strong&gt; When fighting something that knows fewer &lt;strong&gt;techniques&lt;/strong&gt; than you, you deal &lt;strong&gt;extra damage equal to the difference between the number of techniques you and they know,&lt;/strong&gt; up to a maximum of your level.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Mountain: On Fire, the Elements, and Old Gods, Oh My</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/mountain-on-fire-elements-and-old-gods.html</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 14 Apr 2020 16:12:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/mountain-on-fire-elements-and-old-gods.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was going to write about the different kinds of fire that there are, but then I realized it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense if I didn&amp;rsquo;t explain the elements and why fire exists, first, so here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-the-background&#34;&gt;1. The Background &lt;a href=&#34;#1-the-background&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world was created from the Four Elements (Fish, Blood, Ashes, Bones) by the Old Gods, of which there were also four, though their names have been forgotten. When the world was in its infancy all was subject to the laws of Nature, and the elements reigned supreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things carried on this way for a very long time, until eventually Men (featherless bipeds with the capacity to create art) were born. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wizardthieffighter.com/2019/anti-canon-worlds-and-the-uvg/&#34;&gt;Legends and histories contradict each other&lt;/a&gt; on the nature of the first Man:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was a Giant, the ancient dead species of tyrants that built the ruins that dot the Old World and from which Ogres and Whales are descended. Giants created fire but were scared of it and made little use of it; the civilized races evolved later and developed Fire from the knowledge of the Giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was a Blin, a more-intelligent relative of the Ape from which the Goblin, Hobgoblin, and Bugbear (a corruption of “büg” from “big”, and “blyere” from “blyin” which means “man” in the Old Tongue, hence “goblin”, “hobgoblin” etc) races are descended. Blins created Fire in the rites of the primitive Sun-Cults that would eventually birth the Church; the other civilized races evolved later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was an Orc (which race was the first depends, usually, on the orc reciting the myth), created or born somehow from the Old Gods before their death, and from which the other two races of Orc are descended. Orcs created Fire as a tool; the other civilized races were born from confluences of the Four Elements soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was a Dragon, hatched from the egg of the World, and from which Kobolds (and hence, Dragons) are descended. Dragons were born with Fire inside them; the other civilized races were created by Dragons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was a Lizard, hatched from the egg of the World, and from which Lizardfolk are descended. Lizardfolk created Fire to warm themselves; the other civilized races came about by means unknown, except the first Dragons which were a divine punishment upon the most cruel and greedy Lizardfolk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was a Dog, sculpted from mud by the Old Gods, and from which Gnolls (and of course Dogmen) are descended. Fire was given to the Gnolls and Dogmen in secret by the Old Gods; the other civilized races were created later to provide competition and test their skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was a Minotaur, brought into being through the force of his own will, and from which all other civilized races are descended. Minotaurs were granted mastery over Fire by God, and shared with with the other races.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8.&lt;/strong&gt; The first Man was an Elf, a dead race something like an Orc without tusks or a Hobgoblin without fur, and from which Moth Elves were created through a powerful curse for reasons lost to time. The other civilized races were created by the Old Gods to punish them, and Fire came with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regardless of legend, all tell that Fire is the Fifth Element, the False Element, and the greatest symbol of Man&amp;rsquo;s triumph over Nature. Because of this, Fire has been in continual conflict with the Four Elements ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-fire&#34;&gt;2. Fire &lt;a href=&#34;#2-fire&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are four types of fire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;natural-fire&#34;&gt;Natural Fire &lt;a href=&#34;#natural-fire&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called ashfire, hellfire, unholy fire, witchfire, dragonfire, et cetera. If a type of fire is not specified, it&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume it is natural fire. Even fires kindled by other types are typically natural. Natural fire creates smoke, leaves ash, and is an aspect of Ashes rather than Fire itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;holy-fire&#34;&gt;Holy Fire &lt;a href=&#34;#holy-fire&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also called sunfire or consecrated fire, it can be created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html&#34;&gt;paladins&lt;/a&gt;, truly devout priests, and angelic beings (including Fire elementals). Holy fire is Fire made manifest, burns clean and bright with little to no smoke or ash, &lt;strong&gt;cannot harm the truly faithful,&lt;/strong&gt; and deals &lt;strong&gt;double damage to unholy undead, demons, natural elementals,&lt;/strong&gt; and other aspects of Evil or Nature (which are the same thing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;faerie-fire&#34;&gt;Faerie Fire &lt;a href=&#34;#faerie-fire&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faerie fire appears in every way like flame but scintillates through hues from indigo through candy-pink, and burns without heat. It can only be created by fey magic. It &lt;strong&gt;cannot kindle other fires,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;only burns what the fey that created it wishes to.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;battlefire&#34;&gt;BATTLEFIRE &lt;a href=&#34;#battlefire&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;BATTLEFIRE is the rarest and most dangerous type of fire, and can be created only by BATTLEMAGES or mundane warriors who have achieved complete mastery of their martial techniques. It is a coruscating rainbow of color, shot through with octarine spectres of death and violence, and carries with it the sound of battle-cries and clashing steel. BATTLEFIRE &lt;strong&gt;always counts as the most damaging elemental type against any target.&lt;/strong&gt; For example against unholy undead it counts as holy fire, against a stone wall it counts as acid, &amp;amp;c &amp;amp;c.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain: Player&#39;s Handbook</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 17:40:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Holy shit, I&amp;rsquo;m done. This is the player&amp;rsquo;s handbook/player handout for the game I&amp;rsquo;m preparing to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s written for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;GROG (my GLOGhack)&lt;/a&gt; and reproduces some rules from it. It&amp;rsquo;s probably high-powered for most GLOG games but still broadly compatible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWpDnxcvNL6ZgFQ9OmeXgPt2KUJpjue6/view&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dJ1OsVCHOAU/XpOuCsG08KI/AAAAAAAApAQ/cwFXCjD2sd8t2uT5pVhJHNFjPihYpNfzQCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/landscape-11.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PWpDnxcvNL6ZgFQ9OmeXgPt2KUJpjue6/view&#34;&gt;Click here or on mountain to get PDF (55 pages).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And shit, I guess you need a &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5OhTRpLOhkT77ahIIt5CxjKaaMOkDFb/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Character Sheet. Here&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; Here&amp;rsquo;s what&amp;rsquo;s in here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 (7) PC species: Goblinoid (Bugbear, Hobgoblin, Goblin), Orc (&amp;ldquo;True&amp;rdquo;, Water, Half), Moth Elf&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 (11) PC classes: Paladin (Bard, Ranger/Barbarian, Monk, Wizard), Witch (Gun, Bug, Friend, Cancer), False Witch (Sword, Bottle), Gutter Knight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With players &amp;ldquo;unlocking&amp;rdquo; more species and classes from the Bestiary (next on my list) through play&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5 spellcasting Dooms (Sun, Fish, Blood, Ashes, Bones)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-entry spellcasting Chaos/Mishap table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-entry witch/monster weakness table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-entry witch-tulpa table (probably fairly easy to adapt for &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2018/04/osr-100-entities-you-can-summon.html&#34;&gt;Skerples&amp;rsquo; Summoner&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://dndtools.net/classes/binder/&#34;&gt;3.5e Binders&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-entry magic sword table&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-entry bottle-ghost table (captured souls)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20-entry patch-favor table (symbolic tokens given to knights that summon or do things)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Full arms and armor tables with regional namelists, using my &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;overcomplicated melee weapon type rules&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;42 classic D&amp;amp;D spells converted to GLOG (albeit probably most or all ones that have already been done by other people)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;public domain illustrations from old books&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <title>GLOG: Blackhand Warrior</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-blackhand-warrior.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 12 Apr 2020 15:06:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-blackhand-warrior.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LaOiF0RvyGU/XpODnK6Xh3I/AAAAAAAAo_Q/3DGmhMF7qhsRy71cF1sb2VV-MEE1vivqQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/Ashitakabullet.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LaOiF0RvyGU/XpODnK6Xh3I/AAAAAAAAo_Q/3DGmhMF7qhsRy71cF1sb2VV-MEE1vivqQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Ashitakabullet.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I watched Princess Mononoke last night and I&amp;rsquo;m procrastinating editing the spell list for my &amp;lsquo;PHB&amp;rsquo; so here&amp;rsquo;s the main character guy and a bunch of mechanics about sacrificing max HP forever to negate encounters. This guy will probably fuck up your campaign but might be an interesting gamble in &amp;ldquo;how long can I adventure for before the curse consumes me&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your system has variable HD and/or proficiencies, you have them like a Fighter without shields and only light armor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you encounter a spirit of any kind, you can roll Wisdom to intuit what it needs or wants, even if you wouldn&amp;rsquo;t normally be able to communicate with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skills:&lt;br&gt;
1. Bushcraft&lt;br&gt;
2. Diplomacy&lt;br&gt;
3. Shamanism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Red Elk, Fight Like A Demon&lt;br&gt;
B: Clash, Talkdown&lt;br&gt;
C: Stunning Blow&lt;br&gt;
D: Ignore Death&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6KU1He_ZHSo/XpOELCj7sdI/AAAAAAAAo_Y/yC9eQZggFt41aLn23HgmHevA9W2lIgIGQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/b2c7e6dbc50fc08c7f0ca60933f622ff.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6KU1He_ZHSo/XpOELCj7sdI/AAAAAAAAo_Y/yC9eQZggFt41aLn23HgmHevA9W2lIgIGQCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/b2c7e6dbc50fc08c7f0ca60933f622ff.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Red Elk&lt;br&gt;
You have a Red Elk companion, sort of like a giant &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lechwe&#34;&gt;lechwe&lt;/a&gt; or antelope. It has stats like a light warhorse but is smarter, more loyal, and considerably more agile on broken or rocky ground. It&amp;rsquo;s also preternaturally lucky, and will never be intentionally killed in cold blood by an enemy (though it can still be attacked). If you lose it anyway, you suffer incalculable emotional trauma.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PLDMYLoeK_Y/XpOEyuiRVPI/AAAAAAAAo_k/7KVcZljJPzcFSMrJrXsZ5JNQyhn6SVV8QCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/tenor.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PLDMYLoeK_Y/XpOEyuiRVPI/AAAAAAAAo_k/7KVcZljJPzcFSMrJrXsZ5JNQyhn6SVV8QCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tenor.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A: Fight Like A Demon&lt;br&gt;
You carry a curse in your right arm. When you let it loose, you destroy people - more than simply kill them, you separate heads and limbs from bodies with your blows; but each time you do this brings you closer to your death. When you make an attack, you can choose to spend one point of your maximum HP. If you do, the attack automatically hits. Against most opponents, it also automatically kills them (at the GMs discretion, they might instead have it simply deal double maximum damage). If the attack kills its target, they&amp;rsquo;re cleanly dismembered; your blow severs both arms neatly at the elbow, or your arrow punches through their neck and carries their head away with it, etc. Maximum HP spent on this ability can never be regained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you die, you will be reborn as a &lt;a href=&#34;http://fairfieldproject.wikidot.com/operation-secret-santa#toc3&#34;&gt;demon in the form of a writhing mass of worms that retains your approximate shape.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AH47VDVxrpM/XpOGT5GjVKI/AAAAAAAAo_8/8wo1Zdc824oV0WOrW6Ra2SshZ9GRxl_cwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/7cedac619a5dc1332aabd4fb9004ba5a.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AH47VDVxrpM/XpOGT5GjVKI/AAAAAAAAo_8/8wo1Zdc824oV0WOrW6Ra2SshZ9GRxl_cwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/7cedac619a5dc1332aabd4fb9004ba5a.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Clash&lt;br&gt;
While you&amp;rsquo;re armed, once per round you can give up an attack to negate the next melee attack made against you before the beginning of your next turn. If you also spend a point of maximum HP, their weapon is destroyed unless it&amp;rsquo;s a magical or natural weapon. Maximum HP spent on this ability can never be regained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x2VN0Ibgtlc/XpOFmscZH1I/AAAAAAAAo_s/Vkhla6oGC_I5rKtYlJJI3Lqy8McN3e5LwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/PleasingBetterCrane-size_restricted.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-x2VN0Ibgtlc/XpOFmscZH1I/AAAAAAAAo_s/Vkhla6oGC_I5rKtYlJJI3Lqy8McN3e5LwCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/PleasingBetterCrane-size_restricted.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;B: Talkdown&lt;br&gt;
As long as you personally have caused no damage so far, opponents in combat will always hear you out if you attempt to talk them down. They won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily stop fighting you or your allies while you negotiate, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t find a gif, pretend there&amp;rsquo;s one here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C: Stunning Blow&lt;br&gt;
When you hit with an unarmed attack, in place of dealing damage you can have your target roll Constitution (or Strength or a Fortitude Save or whatever your system has) or fall unconscious for a number of minutes equal to the number of Blackhand Warrior templates you have. This ability only works if the target doesn&amp;rsquo;t know you possess it, otherwise they&amp;rsquo;ll be on guard against the technique - i.e. you can use it only once per set of opponents and if they pass their roll you can&amp;rsquo;t try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qa7Y1fTb1nY/XpOF-oHeibI/AAAAAAAAo_0/LsNtu10qqPYDjR3aIkXV-fxB-ScfCAQ8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/tumblr_mbdn3rWkQw1rbrys3o1_r1_500.gif&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qa7Y1fTb1nY/XpOF-oHeibI/AAAAAAAAo_0/LsNtu10qqPYDjR3aIkXV-fxB-ScfCAQ8wCLcBGAsYHQ/s320/tumblr_mbdn3rWkQw1rbrys3o1_r1_500.gif&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;D: Ignore Death&lt;br&gt;
You can take an musket ball to the chest and keep walking. Once per day when an attack would reduce you to 0 or lower HP, you can choose to instead spend any amount of your maximum HP and prevent 10 damage from the attack for each point spent. Maximum HP spent on this ability can never be regained.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Mountain: Setting Precis</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 04:06:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;_This is the setting I&amp;rsquo;m planning to run. It&amp;rsquo;ll be my first fantasy game in a while, I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly run post-apocalyptic stuff and played cyberpunk stuff recently. I&amp;rsquo;ve been heavily inspired by OSR stuff (mostly &lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Goblin Punch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Coins and Scrolls&lt;/a&gt; but also all of &lt;a href=&#34;https://falsemachine.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Patrick Stuart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;Scrap Princess&lt;/a&gt;&amp;rsquo;s stuff and a lot of others) and I&amp;rsquo;m quite sick of &amp;ldquo;standard high fantasy&amp;rdquo; by now, so it&amp;rsquo;s taken on a distinctly weird tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I plan to release a &amp;ldquo;PHB&amp;rdquo; within a month or so since I&amp;rsquo;ve pretty much already written it all, but as I finish formatting stuff for PDF printing and statting it up for &lt;a href=&#34;https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html&#34;&gt;my GLOG hack&lt;/a&gt;, I think I&amp;rsquo;ll post it here._&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have a whole dumb backstory written up, but that&amp;rsquo;ll go in the &amp;ldquo;DMG&amp;rdquo;. The following is what will be in the &amp;ldquo;PHB&amp;rdquo;, as basic setting info for my players. This seemed wise to post now, since it will set the stage for the classes I&amp;rsquo;ll post over the next few days.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several decades ago, a new land was discovered: A vast mountain far across the sea, its peak reaching so far above the clouds that it cannot be seen even when the sky is clear. The prospect of new land to settle prompted an initial flurry of expeditionary fervor from both great empires; the River Kingdoms of the orcs, and the Charter Nations of the goblinoids. It was quickly decided, however, that the voyage to the Mountain at the End of the World was both too long and too dangerous, and the mountain itself too hostile to life, and the colonial efforts rapidly petered out. The people of the great empires were content to live out their lives in petty monotony throughout the civilized lands—until, that is, the sun went out. The world was plunged into darkness for one full day. During that day of darkness many suffered terrifying visions, omens of dark forces emerging from the earth and descending from the sky, and behind them, always behind them, the Mountain at the End of the World.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are no rulers willing to order their armies and navies to die on the shores of strange lands across the sea. There are no priests nor academics willing to risk their lives plumbing the depths of strange caverns. There are only misfits and social outcasts like you—the desperate, insane, or terminally bored. While the kings and emperors in their castles and courts, the wizards in their universities and towers, and the clerics in their temples and churches wrung their hands, you took action. You traveled across the great empires of man, found your way to a port, and booked passage on the next ship set to sail to the Mountain at the End of the World. Your future back in the civilized lands held nothing but exile, imprisonment, or censure. But on, or under, the Mountain at the End of the World, you hope to find something more. Something greater.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLOG: The Adept</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-adept.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 02:51:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-adept.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Wizards are powerful, but limited and dangerous. Once they run out of magic juice, it&amp;rsquo;s all over for them. Your Fireball spell fizzles and you&amp;rsquo;re just someone in a robe, decrepit and terminally out-of-place. Your Sleep goes awry and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.lastgaspgrimoire.com/do-not-take-me-for-some-turner-of-cheap-tricks/&#34;&gt;everything in a 5&amp;rsquo; radius around you is liquefied into a foul-smelling orange pus.&lt;/a&gt; Nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adepts are the opposite. Weak, but they never run out of power and never suffer mishaps. Dabblers in many arcane schools, but never reaching the level of mastery of even the most amateur wizard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/512/1*otBq5sZN7pdJ_QIyDrZOwA.jpeg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://miro.medium.com/max/512/1*otBq5sZN7pdJ_QIyDrZOwA.jpeg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;more like this than a wizard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;adept&#34;&gt;Adept &lt;a href=&#34;#adept&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your system has variable HD and proficiencies, you get the mid-tier ones; like a cleric.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Skill:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. Arcana 2. Stage Magic 3. Con Artistry&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Cantrip Dabbling, 2 Schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Dabble, 1 MD, +2 Schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C:&lt;/strong&gt; Versatile Dabbling, +2 Schools&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Safe Dabbling, +1 Dabbling spell, +2 Schools, +1 MD&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cantrip Dabbling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&amp;rsquo;t cast spells, at least not yet, but you can cast cantrips. Select two &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2017/07/osr-class-wizards.html&#34;&gt;wiz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2013/12/sister-witches-and-monastic-wizards.html&#34;&gt;ard&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/01/more-monastic-wizards.html&#34;&gt;sch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2014/01/even-more-monastic-wizards.html&#34;&gt;ools&lt;/a&gt;, as randomly as possible. You get all of their cantrips. If you end up with cantrips that make absolutely no sense without the rest of the abilities of the school they came from, select another random school instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you gain another Adept template, you acquire two new schools and learn their cantrips in addition to those you already know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dabble&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You gain some very limited spellcasting ability. Pick one of the schools you know cantrips from (including the 2 from this template) and roll a &lt;strong&gt;d6&lt;/strong&gt; on its spell table. You have one Magic Die and can cast that spell like a wizard. When you cast a spell with &lt;strong&gt;1 MD,&lt;/strong&gt; it&amp;rsquo;s only expended if you roll a &lt;strong&gt;6.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you gain the &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Adept template, you can have two &lt;strong&gt;Dabbling&lt;/strong&gt; spells at a time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versatile Dabbling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You learn and forget spells as easily as most people learn and forget little pieces of useless information. Every time you wake from a long rest (or every day at dawn, if you don&amp;rsquo;t sleep), you can choose a new school and re-roll your &lt;strong&gt;Dabble&lt;/strong&gt; spell. You don&amp;rsquo;t have to use this ability if you don&amp;rsquo;t want to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you gain the &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; Adept template, you can choose to reroll one or both of your &lt;strong&gt;Dabbling&lt;/strong&gt; spells when you use this ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safe Dabbling&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You grow in magical power, but retain your cautious nature and unwillingness to let the magic you have learned control you. You gain a second Magic Die, and when you cast a spell with two MD you can choose to ignore one die after rolling them, as if you had never invested or rolled that Magic Die.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>1d20 fantasy languages</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 05 Apr 2020 00:27:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Other ways u can get a sword in a hurry: do enough psychoactive drugs that u are able to see the glass tree behind the world, reach though to it, and snap off a twig (careful, they&amp;rsquo;re sharp) &amp;ndash; idk about you but when I last tripped, a seed of the glass tree behind the world fell into my mind and it has grown into a brambly patch vibrating with swordsong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spoken By&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trader’s Cant (Common)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adventurers, merchants and travelers—Everyone on the Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1. Thieves’ Sign&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soldiers, criminals, deaf and/or mute people. (sign language)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2. High Charter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthy/powerful goblinoids, Charter Nations aristocrats and gentry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3. Court Obsequience&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wealthy/powerful orcs, River Kingdoms nobility and oligarchs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4. Big Talk&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whales, ogres, historians—found on ancient ruins across the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5. The Old Tongue&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wizards, scholars—found on ancient ruins on the Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6. Angelfire&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angels, archons, fire elementals, sunbeams, open flames. Not ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7. Arqot&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dogs and similar—Hyenas, foxes, coyotes, seals, bats. Not wolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8. Artifice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex machines: Mills, siege engines, clockwork. Wagons, barely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9. Scale&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lizards, snakes, frogs, salamanders, testudines, dragonkin. Not fish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10. Skittering&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Especially well-educated moth elves, crabmen, all sorts of arthropods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11. Swordsong&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bards, armorers, false witches, psychonauts, swords. Some knives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12. Chew&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rats, moles, other burrowing mammals, rodents, mustelids, and procyonids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;13. Decay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mushrooms, fungus, mold, bacteria, carrion scavengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;14. Floran&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trees, eloquently, slowly, and at length. Other green plants, less well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;15. Glimmer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gemstones, precious metals. Malicious, deceitful, and bitter if worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;16. Whistle&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rivers, streams, boiling water. Not lakes, seas, or oceans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;17. Hadeal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sharks, fish, deep currents, undertow, darkness underwater.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;18. Serumic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blood, tar, sap, syrup, other viscous liquids. Very sick people, rarely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;19. Ember&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glowing eyes seen in the darkness at night, charcoal, ashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;20. Clatter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Undead, particularly talkative regular dead, bones in general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;heading&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#heading&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;civilized-languages&#34;&gt;Civilized Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#civilized-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trader’s Cant:&lt;/strong&gt; The common language of those who travel; everyone who finds their way to the Mountain is fluent. While it has many words for quality and price, it is unsuited to metaphor or complex meaning. &lt;strong&gt;+2 DC&lt;/strong&gt;to interactions other than haggling in Trader’s Cant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thieves’ Sign:&lt;/strong&gt; Originated in the mafias of the Charter Nations. Quickly adopted by soldiers, bandits, and the deaf or mute. Thieves’ Sign is silent and requires at least one free hand. It has no written form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;High Charter:&lt;/strong&gt; Spoken in the mercantile courts of the Charter Nations. A language of incredible depth and breadth, it allows exquisite construction of compound words and vocabulary serves as a status symbol. You can apply &lt;strong&gt;INT&lt;/strong&gt; instead of &lt;strong&gt;CHA&lt;/strong&gt; to checks and &lt;strong&gt;reaction&lt;/strong&gt; rolls when speaking High Charter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Court Obsequience:&lt;/strong&gt; High speech of the orcish River Kingdoms. In theory a simple tongue with few words, but in practice an elaborate work of metaphor, poetry, flattery, and implication. &lt;strong&gt;+1&lt;/strong&gt; to relevant checks per flattering title invented when speaking Court Obsequience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Big Talk:&lt;/strong&gt; A dead language, found on ruins and other artefacts from the Time Before The Sun. Written in angular strokes implying it was meant to be pressed into tablets. Exceptionally well-suited to intimidation, with as many ways to threaten as most languages have of describing beauty. &lt;strong&gt;+2&lt;/strong&gt; to relevant checks made to intimidate when speaking Big Talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Old Tongue:&lt;/strong&gt; A newly discovered tongue, found on ruins on or in the Mountain. Its alphabet is made up of intricate geometric shapes, meant, like Big Talk, to be pressed into stone or clay. It has similarities to Angelfire, though it is rougher somehow and carries power even when spoken casually. All fire damage dealt by you is increased by &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; if you speak the Old Tongue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;accepted-languages&#34;&gt;Accepted Languages &lt;a href=&#34;#accepted-languages&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;These languages are spoken across the old world, though more rarely than the civilized tongues above. Their use is accepted, though not—except Angelfire—encouraged, by the Church.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Angelfire:&lt;/strong&gt; Angelfire allows communication with angels and fire elementals as well as sunlight and manmade fire. Especially pious speakers sometimes claim to hear the sun itself speak to them—though cross-examination by Church inquisitors invariably finds them either lying or convinced they are telling the truth but unable to recite what it is the sun said. Flames not created through the artifice of man do not speak Angelfire, instead communicating in the heretical language of Ember. Angelfire is considered holy by the Church, and spoken ritually in ceremonies such as marriages, funerals, and mass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arqot:&lt;/strong&gt; Arqot is the barking, yapping, rough-spoken language of dogs and doglike things. Dogs themselves are of course the most prolific speakers of Arqot, chattering and babbling incessant idiocies from their empty minds and flailing tongues. Hyenas and foxes make much better conversation partners, though the former speak with thick accents and strange vocabularies and the latter consider the association with their domesticated cousins shameful and attempt to hide their fluency if at all possible. Wolves do not speak Arqot, in fact the sound of it invariably sends them into a slavering frenzy, attacking the speaker mercilessly and not stopping until they have been torn apart and silenced forever. Seals and sea lions speak the language better than anyone, to the great amusement of all involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Artifice:&lt;/strong&gt; Artifice is the language of machines, spoken most elegantly by clockwork devices and great works of industry such as windmills and blast furnaces. A water clock can speak eloquently and at great length, while a wagon may barely be able to string a few words together. Simple weapons such as cannons are rarely capable of speech, but arbalests and breech-loading or wheellock firearms are sometimes more intelligent than their wielders. Devices are often single minded in their purpose and care little for things beyond it, though devices of great complexity may take interest in related topics—a trebuchet or siege crossbow may have opinions on battlefield strategy and fortification design, and a printing press is likely to have great knowledge of the texts it is used to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scale:&lt;/strong&gt; Scale is the slithering, sibilant tongue of reptiles and amphibians, spoken by snakes, lizards, turtles, tortoises, frogs, salamanders, and others like them. Besides animals, it is the state tongue of Iolund in the far north of the civilized lands—though many would not use those words, precisely, to describe that frozen island where dragons rule over vast clans of kobold raiders and slave-takers. It is not spoken by fish and other scaled sea creatures, who converse in Hadeal and share a mutual hatred with the reptile and amphibian classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skittering:&lt;/strong&gt; Skittering is the language of arthropods and buglike things, spoken in the twitching of an antennae, the positioning of a limb, the clicking of mandibles. Individual insects often speak less than a single word, perhaps a lone phoneme, and each holds only a fraction of a thought—if that. The only way to speak with them is to converse with the hive itself, combining every lone voice into a sibilant, buzzing whole. Larger, more solitary arthropods can often carry on a conversation on their own, though they tend to have less complete minds than a hive; a crab might be able to converse with a sailor about the waves and deep-sea currents, but would have little opinion on them besides as they directly relate to it and its own well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swordsong:&lt;/strong&gt; Songs are swords. Some say the pen is mightier than the sword—while this is not strictly true, it serves well as a metaphor; with a pen, you can make as many swords as you want to. This is because swords are songs and vice versa; a tune eventually hardens into a blade. There is a correlation between quality of song and elegance of blade, but even more so, there is a correlation between number of listeners and power of enchantment. It is widely known that this is where magic swords come from, vast caverns beneath the earth filled with the oiled and sharpened progeny of long-forgotten ditties. In a pinch you can whistle yourself a dagger if you know what you’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;wild-tongues&#34;&gt;Wild Tongues &lt;a href=&#34;#wild-tongues&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;The languages known as “wild tongues” are considered heretical by the Church, their speakers hunted down across the civilized lands. Speaking one might be enough reason in and of itself for one to come to the Mountain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chew:&lt;/strong&gt; The chattering, familiar language of rodents and other burrowing or scavenging small mammals. Mice are timid, rats crude, stoats and weasels sinister and focused, otters playful, badgers stoic, and raccoons clever. It is an essential tenet of all Chew-speaking creatures not to converse with anyone who has not brought something to offer them—people who speak Chew often carry additional food and small treasures for this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decay:&lt;/strong&gt; The soft-spoken language of rot and bacteria, fungus and mold. It can be heard in most places if one is paying attention; particularly where things continually grow and die in a cycle. Besides direct agents of decay it is also sometimes spoken by carrion scavengers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Floran:&lt;/strong&gt; The language of plant life in all its forms. Trees speak it in heavy, creaking voices and have amassed great knowledge in their long lives. Grass whispers it—thankfully, since it has little to say. Flowers speak it prettily, but are incapable as a rule of conveying anything of value to the listener. Clonal colonies are sometimes more knowledgeable than any individual, but interpreting their cacophony into a single thread of conversation can be challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Glimmer:&lt;/strong&gt; The sibilant and persuasive language of treasure, spoken by gemstones and precious metals. In natural formations they are both accommodating and wise, but once alloyed, cast, forged, cut, or worked they become bitter and filled with hate. Yes, one who speaks Glimmer can talk to coins—but they should never trust them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistle:&lt;/strong&gt; The bright and simple language of water in motion, spoken by rushing rivers, babbling brooks, and roaring waterfalls. It is not spoken by ocean waves, though whether that is a genuine incapability is a matter of much debate. Seawater can be persuaded to speak Whistle by boiling it, but the transformation to steam purges it of any memories it might have held and steam is often too fleeting to speak to in any meaningful fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hadeal:&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed anti-language of the ocean depths, spoken by sharks, fish, eels, octopodes, currents, undertow, and any body of saltwater connected to the sea. It is not spoken by whales, dolphins, other aquatic mammals, or sea-dwelling arthropods—the last of which converse in Skittering. The ocean itself is very powerful and very wise, but its voice is too loud, slow, and implacable to be understood by mortals even if it deigned to speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serumic:&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed anti-language of the red darkness in the hearts of man. Spoken slowly and deliberately by pitch and tar, stickily-sweet by tree sap, but most eloquently in an oscillating flow between violent and sanguine by blood itself. Speakers have their ears filled with the chatter of their circulatory system, which is comforting to many but will seldom tell them anything they don&amp;rsquo;t already know. The very ill sometimes wake from their deathbeds to recite the events of their lives in perfect Serumic. Known as the blood-confession, this was once a natural sacrament which preceded a peaceful death. In the years since the Church rose to power, it has instead been taken as evidence the patient has an overabundance of blood to be let by a surgeon—a much less comfortable end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ember:&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed anti-language of burned things—charcoal, soot, and ash. It is also spoken spark-quick and frantic by unconsecrated flame, breathily by geysers and steam-vents, and slowly, heavy with the weight of ages, by magma. Even things that burn without ash can speak Ember, though the Church attempts to suppress this knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clatter:&lt;/strong&gt; The cursed anti-language of the ivory scaffolding that lurks within all vertebrae, the chains binding us to our chordate ancestors, the bars of the prison of the flesh. Cartilage speaks a dialect so different as to be almost impossible to understand, but teeth and horns translate easily enough. Hair whispers it; in short, broken strands or long, flowing curls, but is so vain as to be generally considered a waste of time to talk to.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLOG: TIME KNIGHT</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-time-knight.html</link>
      <pubDate>Sat, 04 Apr 2020 16:37:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-time-knight.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OSR discord user diregrizzlybear pointed out that 5e had this kind of cool idea, but its attached to a shitty system and about 20 dead levels and, I think, split between two classes, so here it is bolted to the GLOG chassis! This is probably pretty strong for an OSR game but oh well&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-felt-free-to-use-gamey-stuff-like-per-session-powers-here-because-you-know-timefuckery-constants-and-variables&#34;&gt;I felt free to use gamey stuff like per-session powers here because, you know, timefuckery. Constants and variables. &lt;a href=&#34;#i-felt-free-to-use-gamey-stuff-like-per-session-powers-here-because-you-know-timefuckery-constants-and-variables&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h2 id=&#34;time-knight&#34;&gt;TIME KNIGHT &lt;a href=&#34;#time-knight&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 id=&#34;aka-chronorebel-aka-echoblade&#34;&gt;AKA Chronorebel AKA Echoblade &lt;a href=&#34;#aka-chronorebel-aka-echoblade&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;If your game has variable HD and proficiencies, etc, you have them like a Fighter. You start with normal equipment from mismatched eras, and 2d6 wrist- and stop-watches of varying make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skill:&lt;/strong&gt; 1. History 2. Arcana 3. Pedantics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Manifest Echo, 1 Echo Ability&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; +1 Echo, +1 Echo Ability&lt;br&gt;
**C: **+1 Echo, +1 Echo Ability&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; +1 Echo, +1 Echo Ability&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Manifest Echo&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per turn in place of your movement &lt;strong&gt;or&lt;/strong&gt; your action, you can manifest an echo of yourself from an alternate timeline. The echo looks like a faded version of you and appears in your space. It has all your stats, no weight or substance to speak of (though it can still be hit and can&amp;rsquo;t walk through solid objects), immunity to status effects, and moves at your speed with your mental command (no action, but only on your turn). You can have one echo at a time per TIME KNIGHT template. They are destroyed if they take any damage, are more than 30 feet away from you, you lose consciousness, or after 30 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Echo Abilities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Time is fickle. When you gain a TIME KNIGHT template, roll 1d4, 1d3, or 1d2 on the table depending on how many echo abilities you already have. If you have 3 and gain another one, it&amp;rsquo;s automatically the one you don&amp;rsquo;t have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Convergent Future&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per session before a die is rolled, you can choose to have it treated as if it rolled a number of your choice. This can&amp;rsquo;t cause &amp;ldquo;critical effects&amp;rdquo;, the interpretation of which is up to your GM.&lt;br&gt;
**&lt;br&gt;
2.** &lt;strong&gt;Echo Fade&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When an attack hits something sharing the same space as any of your echos, the attacker must make roll Wisdom once for each echo. If they fail, their attack hits the echo instead (which destroys it).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Echo Superposition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can see and hear through your echoes as if you were in their place. When you begin your turn (or once every few seconds, if not tracking time in combat rounds) you can swap places with any of your echoes.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;4. Echo Reality&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can force any of your echoes into reality for a brief moment before the timestream erases it as a paradox. This lets it take one action as if it were actually you. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t take an action on your part, but any echo you use this ability on is destroyed immediately after taking the action. If your echo uses something of limited use that you have, it counts as having been used for you and all your other echoes.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLOG: The GROG</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 03 Apr 2020 00:11:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;With apologies to Arnold K and Skerples; I have done a very ill-advised and possibly unholy thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have grafted bits of &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.d20srd.org/index.htm&#34;&gt;D&amp;amp;D 3.5 AKA the d20 system&lt;/a&gt; (because that&amp;rsquo;s what I grew up on and still informs a lot of my tastes) to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://coinsandscrolls.blogspot.com/2019/10/osr-glog-based-homebrew-v2-many-rats-on.html&#34;&gt;GL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-glog.html&#34;&gt;OG&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvTAQxdi0GP0QwheUiQbMDyMzwvWF8iM/view&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-qtu9h7rOokg/Xobf59uUfXI/AAAAAAAAo7c/3mB7J9JnKScoL6GxNWUy5RJpH6jdVe1UQCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/GROGlogo.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://draft.blogger.com/&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s called &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hvTAQxdi0GP0QwheUiQbMDyMzwvWF8iM/view&#34;&gt;the Goblin Ruins Of Gaming, or the GROG, and you can get it right here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And shit, I guess you need a &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B5OhTRpLOhkT77ahIIt5CxjKaaMOkDFb/view?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;Character Sheet. Here&amp;rsquo;s that.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notable features AKA &amp;ldquo;what makes this different from every other GLOGhack or indeed OSR-adjacent ruleset&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Four base stats! Modifiers only! Basically point-buy!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Complex combat rules! Grappling rules!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s only 8 pages including the cover!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The header font is called Goblin One!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no content in here, but I was writing a whole game and setting as a d20hack and I think I&amp;rsquo;ll shift it over to this because I like it better so expect bits of that soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Ironically, about seven minutes after I published this, Arnold &lt;a href=&#34;https://goblinpunch.blogspot.com/2020/04/stat-squish-and-lawful-roll.html&#34;&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; that he was abandoning roll-under for the GLOG in favor of only having modifiers. The d20hack I am abandoning only had modifiers (although it was a much more standard-for-d20 roll-to-beat-arbitrary-DC system). All things are thus in balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT EDIT&lt;/strong&gt;**:**&lt;br&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve updated the ruleset as of 2020-05-21, after running some playtesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT EDIT EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here we are, nearly a year later (2021-05-01) and I&amp;rsquo;ve rewritten the whole damn thing to be a lot simpler. Gone are the novel dice mechanics and weapon tags, which feels like killing a part of me but it&amp;rsquo;s a part that had to die. Also, oops, back to modifiers-only stats. Hah.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>GLOG: Spaceships, Or: GLOGSTAR</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-spaceships.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 13:32:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/04/glog-spaceships.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;OSR discord user &lt;a href=&#34;https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;deus ex parabola&lt;/a&gt; was talking about making a GLOG class to play a fucked up spaceship and I took the idea and ran with it. These are some classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hull damage is HP damage, crew damage is nonlethal; a duty cycle is a day; main guns are two-handed weapons; armored bulkheads are leather, belts are chain, and citadels are plate; comm arrays are the ability to speak; an &amp;ldquo;su&amp;rdquo; is a foot; maintaining command over small craft is concentrating on a spell; etc. I&amp;rsquo;m assuming d20-esque rules for being at 0 HP and below (half speed and actions at 0 HP, unconscious and dying at -1 to -9, dead at -10).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;class-carrier&#34;&gt;Class: Carrier &lt;a href=&#34;#class-carrier&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a wizard school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;**Perk: **&lt;strong&gt;Dedicated Tactical Net&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As long as your comm arrays are online, you can maintain command over as many units of small craft as you have fighter bays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Drawback: Flat Top&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can&amp;rsquo;t mount main guns or armor citadels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cantrips:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;1. Long-Range Sensors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can examine anything you can see as if it was right in front of you.&lt;br&gt;
**2. **&lt;strong&gt;Damage Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per duty cycle, when you would take hull damage, you can choose to take half as much crew damage instead.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;3. Hyperwave Command Relay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Take 1d4 crew damage to communicate a short, one-way message to anything you know the position of. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ANYTHING.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spells:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Subcapital ships are spells. Fighter bays are spell slots. Deployment dice are magic dice - when they&amp;rsquo;re expended, all your spaceframes are under construction/repair/refit/etc. Your fighters are unique to you - one carrier&amp;rsquo;s interceptor squadron might be an uncountable tide of dog-sized drones, another&amp;rsquo;s might be just a few flights of extremely skilled aces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you deploy a unit of small craft with a duration of &amp;lsquo;command&amp;rsquo;, attach the deployment die used to deploy it. You don&amp;rsquo;t regain that die until the unit is recalled&amp;ndash;if it&amp;rsquo;s killed, the die is automatically expended even if it wasn&amp;rsquo;t when you rolled it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Interceptor Squadron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; short &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; [dice] 10 su cubes &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; command&lt;br&gt;
You launch [dice] squadrons of quick, agile interceptors. Defensive, movement etc stats as swarms of insects. Enemies within an interceptor squadron&amp;rsquo;s area take 1 damage every round per area they are inside of. Enemy missiles fired through the area are automatically destroyed unless there&amp;rsquo;s some reason why they wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be. Particularly fast/armored/numerous/etc missiles have a 50% chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Fighter Squadron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; medium &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; n/a &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; command&lt;br&gt;
You launch [dice] flights of versatile, maneuverable heavy fighters. Each flight has 1 HD, 2 HP, \armored bulkheads (as leather), and moves about as fast as a kobold or goblin. They&amp;rsquo;re armed with light melee weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Bomber Squadron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; long &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; up to [dice] capital-scale targets &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; command&lt;br&gt;
You launch [dice] slow, deadly bombers. Each bomber has 1 HD, 6 HP, armor belts (as chain), and moves at half your speed. Each is armed with a single heavy barrage (range = 30 su, damage = the deployment die assigned to the bomber + 2) which always hits capital-scale enemies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Minefield&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; short &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; [dice] 10 su cubes &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; n/a (permanent)&lt;br&gt;
You disperse [dice] automated drone minefields. Anything that sees you do this can tell where the minefields are, but you can choose to include a beacon marking the area as containing a minefield or not. Anything entering or starting its turn inside the minefield saves or takes 1d6 damage. Mines can only be cleared with area-of-effect damage or dedicated equipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. Shield Drone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; short &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; plane or sphere &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; command&lt;br&gt;
You deploy a small field-projecting drone with an internal power source, which moves like a kobold or goblin. The field is a 10 su square or a sphere enveloping the drone and one adjacent unit and has [sum] hull points. The field and drone share HP and attacks against them automatically hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Lockdown&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; short &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; up to [sum] HD &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; until counteracted or one duty cycle&lt;br&gt;
You launch a wave of disposable gremlin drones which overwhelm the targets&amp;rsquo; systems. Targets must save or have their systems completely shut down (as sleep) until they receive assistance from an adjacent unit (requires an action). Unaware targets don&amp;rsquo;t get a save.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Destabilize Volume&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;R:&lt;/strong&gt; self &lt;strong&gt;T:&lt;/strong&gt; [dice] * 10 su radius area &lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; [sum] duty cycles&lt;br&gt;
You launch a cloud of disposable drones that emit micro-gravitic distortions and instabilities throughout the local volume. Anything entering or starting movement within the area must save or stop moving and spin randomly. You are immune to this deployment&amp;rsquo;s effects, but your allies are not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for spells 8-12 pick another wizard school. you and your GM are responsible for converting their spells into space fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;class-exploration-cruiser&#34;&gt;Class: Exploration Cruiser &lt;a href=&#34;#class-exploration-cruiser&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a thief.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Mission Package, Surveying Scanners, Emission Capacitor&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Versatile Holds, Variable Internal Geometry, Stabilized Drive Field&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C:&lt;/strong&gt; Targeting Array&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Micro-Jump, Flotilla Modifications&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Mission Package&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
When you have access to a market, you can spend any amount of credits/requisition to prepare a Mission Package. Whenever you want, you can deploy a possessed Mission Package to acquire any other items, including other Mission Packages, that don&amp;rsquo;t exceed the amount you paid for the original package or your free inventory slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Surveying Scanners&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
By spending an action, you can become aware of the bulk contents, composition, and relative value of any adjacent target.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Emission Capacitor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You get a +1 bonus per Exploration Cruiser template you possess to any attempts you make to move stealthily or disguise yourself as another vessel. You can make stealth checks even against targets that have you on their long-range scans. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t work within visual range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Versatile Holds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You get 3 additional Fast Inventory slots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Variable Internal Geometry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per day per Exploration Cruiser template you possess, you can turn a critical hit against you into a normal hit OR discard any number of inventory slots worth of items to reduce damage taken from a hit by 4 per slot discarded. Items discarded through this ability are destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Stabilized Drive Field&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You always count as having any applicable terrain/atmosphere/hazard modifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Targeting Array&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Whenever you have a situational bonus to an attack roll, your attack deals an additional die of damage. Allies attacking a target that you have successfully hit before in this combat get a +2 bonus to their attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Micro-Jump&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per duty cycle, you can engage your jump drive for an accurate short distance micro-jump. As an action, you disappear and reappear up to 50 su away, regardless of obstacles. You take 1d6 crew damage per 5 su traveled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Flotilla Modifications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
At your option, you can spend one use of your Variable Internal Geometry ability to grant its benefit OR your Stabilized Drive Field benefit to any ally in your flotilla. In the case of Stabilized Drive Field, the benefit applies to one hazard or type of terrain and lasts until the end of the scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;class-warship&#34;&gt;Class: Warship &lt;a href=&#34;#class-warship&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a fighter.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;A:&lt;/strong&gt; Ironclad, Spinal Weapon&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;B:&lt;/strong&gt; Compartmentalized Hull, Battle Stations&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;C:&lt;/strong&gt; Shield Projection, Overload&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;D:&lt;/strong&gt; Redundant Systems, Two Rounds Rapid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Ironclad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per duty cycle, you can reduce one instance of incoming damage by 1d12. If you willingly overload your shields (destroying the emitter/generator), it counts as rolling a 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A: Spinal Weapon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You have a massive spinal cannon, gauss rifle, or other giant and immensely powerful weapon mounted centrally in your hull. It starts at 0 charges at the beginning of combat, charges at a rate of 1 die per round spent in combat at the end of each of your turns, and can hold a charge of up to 2 dice per Warship template you possess. Firing it takes an attack as normal and deals 1d8 damage per die of charge stored. It takes no range penalties and can be targeted out to the limits of your visual range or sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Compartmentalized Hull&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You are automatically stabilized and remain able to move and act normally at 0 HP and below. You still die at -10 HP. If crew damage would bring you below -10 HP you are unable to act, but remain stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B: Battle Stations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can choose to call all crew to battle stations at the start of your turn or in response to taking damage. While at battle stations, you can make one additional attack each round and prevent half of all crew damage taken, but cannot take any defensive, curative, or tactical actions. Record all crew damage prevented through use of this ability - when battle stations ends, you take all of it at once. Battle stations lasts until the end of the combat or scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Shield Projection&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Once per round if your shields are online and an adjacent ally is targeted with an attack, you can make an attack roll. If successful, your ally gains the benefit of your Ironclad ability. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t take a usage of the ability, but you can still choose to overload your shields to maximize the damage reduction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C: Overload&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can expend all currently held Spinal Weapon charge dice as an action or in response to being hit to create damaging arcs of electricity to all targets within 5 su per dice, dealing 1d6 damage per dice expended. Targets can save to take half damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Redundant Systems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
All incoming hull damage is reduced by 1 point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D: Two Rounds Rapid&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
You can make one additional attack each round.&lt;/p&gt;

      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/03/plagues-and-poxes.html</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 13:39:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/03/plagues-and-poxes.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Content warning:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a list of fantasy diseases. If you&amp;rsquo;re stressed about the current real-life (decidedly un-fantastic) epidemic sweeping the earth, it might be best to skip this one. Take care of yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;My friend has maladies, rickets, and allergies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That she dates back to the 17th century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Somehow she manages, in her misery&amp;hellip;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rememberdismove.blogspot.com/2020/03/d20-diseases_28.html&#34;&gt;Some people&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href=&#34;https://unlawfulgames.blogspot.com/2020/03/strange-diseases-picked-up-while.html&#34;&gt;posting diseases&lt;/a&gt; lately, so I decided to join in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here&amp;rsquo;s wonderwall&lt;strong&gt;the list of diseases (and one deadly poison) for the fantasy game i&amp;rsquo;m writing&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;disease-and-poison&#34;&gt;Disease and Poison &lt;a href=&#34;#disease-and-poison&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disease and poison are an ever-present threat on the wild shores of the Mountain, and in truth even in the civilized world. Unliving things such as undead, constructs, and immortals are immune to poison and disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;poisons-and-venoms&#34;&gt;Poisons and Venoms &lt;a href=&#34;#poisons-and-venoms&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poison deals damage and/or a secondary effect. When a character is first exposed to the poison they roll &lt;strong&gt;Strength.&lt;/strong&gt; If they fail, the poison has entered their system and they take its damage or effects, then &lt;strong&gt;repeat the roll the next round or take it again—repeating each round until they succeed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A typical poison is &lt;strong&gt;Grandmother’s Tongue,&lt;/strong&gt; a black, viscous liquid that can be processed out of the teeth of humanoids that have devoured their children. It can be delivered through ingestion or injury, deals &lt;strong&gt;3d6 damage per round,&lt;/strong&gt; and costs &lt;strong&gt;3,000 sp per dose.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;diseases-and-maladies&#34;&gt;Diseases and Maladies &lt;a href=&#34;#diseases-and-maladies&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When a character is first exposed to a disease or malady they roll a &lt;strong&gt;stat&lt;/strong&gt; according to the disease. On a failure, they have contracted the disease in its incubation stage, and reroll the next day or suffer the effects. Any hit point or ability score damage caused by a disease cannot be healed until the disease is cured.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;stages-of-disease&#34;&gt;Stages of Disease &lt;a href=&#34;#stages-of-disease&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Incubation/Remission.&lt;/strong&gt; When a disease is in its incubation or remission stage its effects on a character are lessened, but they still do not recover from any damage caused by it and roll against the disease each day. On a success, the character fights off the disease and is cured. On a failure, the disease progresses/returns to the advanced stage and applies its effects to the character again.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced.&lt;/strong&gt; When a disease is in its advanced stage the character rolls against the disease every day or suffers its effects. On a success, the disease goes into &lt;strong&gt;remission&lt;/strong&gt; and does not affect the character that day—though any lasting effects and damage persist.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h4 id=&#34;disease-and-malady-list&#34;&gt;Disease and Malady List &lt;a href=&#34;#disease-and-malady-list&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brewer’s Buboes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d3 Wisdom damage. Your flesh is slowly eaten away by yeast, processing the sugars in your blood directly into alcohol. Swollen buboes on the soft parts of your body produce strong, clear liquor when pierced. Drinking the liquor causes brewer’s buboes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Caver’s Curse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Reverses the effects of gravity on you and anything you’re personally carrying. Can be contracted by surviving at least 10d6 falling damage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Charsight&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Your eyes turn into burning coals, causing you to go blind. Anything you look at takes 1d6 natural fire damage per round as it curls and blackens, burning without flame. Your eyelids burn off immediately. It’s real hard to look at stuff when you’re blind—you can roll Wisdom opposed by AC to hit a specific thing, but only if you have some other way of knowing where it is. Alternatively, someone else could just aim your head like a cannon with a DEX Attack roll. This can be contracted from inhaling the ashes of an unconsecrated fire, and is deeply stigmatized as a sign that one handles natural flame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doggart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Blood, blood, you have too much blood. You have to let the blood out by taking at least 6 points of hit point damage per day from sources that cause bleeding (points and edges) or take 1 Strength damage as your blood is diluted and your organs are overwhelmed. On the upside, you can’t bleed out and can roll twice on the death &amp;amp; dismemberment table and take the most fortuitous result. You can catch this by ingesting the blood of dogs or dogmen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fish Cysts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; White, pink, orange, or green-black cyst-eggs form all across your skin. They rapidly mature and hatch, spawning horrible toothed fish like leaping piranhas. Whenever you start your turn within 5 feet of another creature, one fish spawns for each creature within 5 feet of you and launches itself at them, making a ranged attack with DEX Attack 11 and dealing 1 damage plus attaching itself if it hits. You take 1 damage for every fish-cyst that spawns a fish.&lt;br&gt;
Attached fish deal 1 damage each round at the end of the creature they’re attached to’s turn. A fish can be pulled off and crushed with an attack action, or can be attacked. Attached fish have 1 hit point and 0 AC. A “missed” attack roll against the fish still kills it, but also deals damage to the creature it was attached to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gremlins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Dexterity&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Tiny invisible creatures are ruining your life. Nobody else can see them, but they dog your every move, getting in the way and fucking up everything you try to do. Whenever you roll a natural 20, it counts as a natural 1—meaning you not only can’t critically succeed at anything, you critically fail twice as often. These can be contracted by looking at someone who has them while you’re able to see invisible creatures—they see you back and run at you, the Dexterity roll is to dodge them or shake them off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Leaks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Your stomach turns, and thin, corrosive goo leaks out of your mouth, eyes, ears, nose, and every other orifice. The goo deals 1 acid damage to anything it touches and carries the leaks, but your body chemistry is altered enough to prevent 1 point of acid damage from every source or attack. Whenever you take a full-round or attack action in combat, you must roll an additional save against the disease or puke up a load of acidic phlegm, interrupting your action and covering one adjacent target of your choice in corrosive mucus.&lt;br&gt;
This is a common ailment in the wet season, much like a flu. It is traditionally treated by stripping the patient naked and burying them in dirt in the middle of a field or village commons, feeding them plenty of thin broth and tea until they recover. Once the patient is cured, the dirt mound is burned.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Loamflesh&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d4 Strength damage, and reduces natural AC by 1 each day to a minimum of 0. Your flesh turns soft and spongy, like loamy soil, and smells of rotting wood and decay like a forest floor. Flowers, mushrooms, and moss sprout from your skin. Heals you 1d8 hit points per day and produces enough vegetation to keep three medium-sized creatures well fed as long as you drink enough water. The food carries loamflesh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Milk Heart&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d4 Dexterity damage, and gain +1 Strength to a maximum of 18. You grow fat, swollen and pale, your muscles hypertrophying even as you lose mobility. You can contract this by becoming used to a life of luxury, then leaving it cold turkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moon Rash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d6 Wisdom damage, but you only suffer the effects of this damage while in moonlight. Your skin becomes covered with an itchy red rash that only appears under the light of the moon. If you are reduced to 0 or lower Wisdom in this manner, you melt into a silver shadow and flow upwards into the moon like a river of airborne milk. You can see as well in moonlight as you can at noon on a clear day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantom Limb&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d2 Strength damage. A ghost limb or other extremity, created when a part of a creature is amputated and the creature dies before that part, has attached itself to your soul. Can be immediately cured by abjuration effects or being captured in a ghost-bottle. If you drop to 0 or lower Strength while so afflicted, whichever extremity is a mirror of the phantom limb fully withers away and is permanently replaced by the ghost, which exists only partially on the material plane and won’t always listen to you. This “cures” the malady and allows the ability damage to begin healing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Purple Delusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d3 Wisdom damage. You become absolutely egotistical and self-enamoured, plagued by visions of grandeur, and become able to see ghosts and other invisible creatures. Your soul is condemned to hell, and ghosts will tell you this. You can catch this by drinking ghosts that were afflicted with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ratspite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Must roll Wisdom to not kill people for their shinies or food, if there’s a likelihood that you could get away with it. Take 1 difficulty to all actions in bright light, but can see just as well in dim light as most people can during the day. Your eyes turn black and beady, and you hyperfocus on precious metals and gems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Salt Shakes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d4 Strength damage, and you need to eat and drink twice as much as normal to gain the same effects. You become dehydrated and weakened, but the salt consumes other diseases and maladies, magical or otherwise—each day, roll randomly to determine a random other disease or malady that is cured by the salt shakes. Named because of the incidental shaking and twitching that patients get due to dehydration. Can be contracted by putting salt on your wounds while afflicted with any other disease or malady of a magical nature, which is most of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Snoos&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Whenever affected by magic, you are stunned for 1 round. This can trigger only once per magical effect. You get a tickle in your nose and throat, and are afflicted by fits of sneezing and dry coughs, like a bad case of hay fever. It’s pronounced like and rhymes with “noose”. You can catch this though overexposure to magic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sparkmouth&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Touching iron, steel, or other ferrous metals deals you 1 point of damage per round. Deep indigo shows around your mouth and eyes like bruises, traces your surface veins, might appear in blotches on other parts of your skin. Only actually causes you to spit sparks if you have metal tooth fillings. You can catch this by doing too much moth dust. Moth elves are immune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sunspots&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1 Strength damage. Dark, perfectly circular spots with faded edges show on your skin, slowly growing with exposure to sunlight. Your bones are burned away from the inside, slowly turning them brittle and hollow. You can catch this by letting sunlight touch your exposed bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sword Sickness&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Iron and steel rot away at your touch, gaining 1 notch or taking 1d6 damage for every round you are in contact with them. Taking damage from a weapon isn’t enough contact to rot it. You can catch this by taking damage from a sword that was used to kill its own creator. If you have sword sickness, swords won’t talk to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Toothsome Hunger&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Wisdom&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; You develop an uncontrollable urge to consume teeth. Any teeth. All teeth. Your teeth are going to fall out, so you need to store up more of them inside you so that you don’t run out. You need them. Whenever there are teeth around that you could eat—in a corpse, on the ground, in the mouth of a living thing that it seems likely you could take them from without severe consequences—roll Wisdom or ignore everything else until you have taken and eaten the teeth. Add 5 difficulty if there is no immediate threat to your person that could prevent you from eating the teeth. You can get this by suffering from poor dental hygiene for an extended period, losing teeth, or eating teeth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twinkles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Take 1 hit point damage whenever you move more than 30 feet in a single round. Your skin forms miniature, razor-sharp crystalling growths that refract light like tiny prisms and chafe horribly when you move in any fashion other than very slowly and carefully. Creatures in a grapple with you take 1 damage for every grapple check that they make. This is a common childhood illness, like chicken pox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Witching Plague&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Strength&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; 1d6 Strength damage. You develop swollen buboes that leak black pus, and rapidly succumb to fever, weakness, and death. Commonly spread by fleas and infected vermin, witching plague has been a constant threat throughout most of history in the civilized world and folk remedies for it abound. Eating a large quantity of raw garlic actually has some efficacy (roll Strength twice, take highest result) in treating the disease. It’s not actually related to witches in the slightest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Zaps&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Save:&lt;/strong&gt; Dexterity&lt;br&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Effects:&lt;/strong&gt; Add 2 difficulty to social interaction rolls, and when you roll an odd number for initiative you are stunned for the first round of combat. You’re afflicted by twitches, spasm, microseizures, and brain zaps. Whenever you take electricity damage, you can roll Dexterity to cause any target adjacent to you to also take damage as if targeted by the same effect. You can catch this from being struck by lightning, or taking a great deal (more than 10) of magical electricity damage.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Post-Apocalyptic Generator Dump</title>
      <link>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/03/random-generators-for-apocalypse-and.html</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 25 Mar 2020 18:45:00 -0700</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://madqueenscourt.com/2020/03/random-generators-for-apocalypse-and.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi yes hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;over the last nearly-a-decade i have run several campaigns set in a post-apocalyptic greater vancouver area (lower mainland, BC, pacific northwest, canada, etc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i also made a lot of random generators using the engine at &lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/&#34;&gt;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;here they are, collected for your perusal, but first, some preamble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble---the-setting&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PREAMBLE - THE SETTING&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#preamble---the-setting&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everything gets worse forever. At every junction of history (starting from when i started writing this, so the early 2010s) everything that could go wrong, did. Imagine the current surrealist hellscape we live in, if nobody even pretended like things were going to work out. This resulted in nuclear war breaking out in mid-2028, initially limited to China and the USA but quickly expanding to include, well, most of the world. Vancouver BC (the setting for the game) escaped direct damage, but quickly devolved into apocalyptic chaos regardless. The mood is very gonzo, sort of like a more-cyberpunk Fallout with the Wild Wasteland perk jammed on. Fallout wasn&amp;rsquo;t a main inspiration though, at least not directly - a specific dead MOO was, which &lt;em&gt;itself&lt;/em&gt; was heavily inspired by Fallout among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game was set around the year 2070, approximately forty years after the apocalypse that ended the world, but the setting included plenty of sci-fi stuff that doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; make sense to have existed in 2028, and also a dash of STALKER-esque radiation-horror-magic, because that&amp;rsquo;s fun. I think it was later retconned to have been at least partially a result of time/dimension travel, but that&amp;rsquo;s not really present in the mechanics-as-lore, more of a background thing as an easter egg for my friends because one of them ran a game where we were time and dimensional travelers and it neatly explained all the anachronisms and fucked up shit in my apocalypse setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble--the-system&#34;&gt;**PREAMBLE - **&lt;strong&gt;THE SYSTEM&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#preamble--the-system&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;the game was run using a hacked-together system based (somewhat loosely) on d20 Modern and/or D&amp;amp;D 3.5. it diverged from those more significantly as time went on, but i think the first campaign actually did use the d20 Modern Strong/Fast/Tough/Smart/Wise/Charismatic hero classes - later ones were classless. i also wrote a gigantic table of firearm damage by specific real-world caliber, which is fun if your gaming group has gun nerds in it. maybe i&amp;rsquo;ll post that later&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway, this stuff should all be directly compatible with d20 (D&amp;amp;D 3.5-esque) systems, and compatible without much too much effort with other editions of D&amp;amp;D and systems derived from or inspired by them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;notable differences from the basic d20 system:&lt;br&gt;
- Wisdom bonus applies to AC and initiative, i liked this because it made it a lot more valuable and made Dex &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; less obviously the best statistic (it still was though)&lt;br&gt;
- Armor has HP as well as an AC bonus, in practice this was fiddly as hell and I recommend ignoring it - or ignoring the AC bonus and just using the HP, if you like the flavor of pulling your shattered plate carrier off after taking a round to the chest&lt;br&gt;
- max level was 6&lt;br&gt;
- by the end at least, there were no classes&lt;br&gt;
- also by the end (i.e. some of the generators may not reflect this) ability scores were replaced entirely with their (d20 system) modifiers, meaning for ex. the average strength for a human was &amp;ldquo;+0&amp;rdquo;, not &amp;ldquo;10&amp;rdquo;. you can probably convert this in your head but i thought i&amp;rsquo;d mention it, also of note because it means that stuff with stat effects should most likely be doubled if you use this in a d20 system game (i.e. something that gives &amp;ldquo;+1 STR&amp;rdquo; is meant to give a +1 bonus to strength &lt;em&gt;modifier)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;if you plan to use this stuff with OSR-type games then probably just cut weapon damage waaaaay down, like maybe in half or something, and probably scale skill modifiers down as well (and interpret them to fit your system ofc)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CONTENT WARNING:&lt;/strong&gt; some of these (notably the Tattoo generator, and the Jerk and Dog ones by proxy along with any others that include it) contain some problematic shit, because the setting is a hellworld steeped in 2010s-2020s internet culture with zero social context. there shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be any slurs, but a jerk might have some nazi tattoos or something because they&amp;rsquo;re a jerk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;okay on to the generators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generators---the-best-ones&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GENERATORS - THE BEST ONES&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#generators---the-best-ones&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;these are the best/most useful/funniest. a lot of them import stuff from other ones, because that&amp;rsquo;s a thing you can do. i heartily recommend bookmarking these if you plan to do anything wacky and/or post-apocalyptic&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=qXYg4QMc&#34;&gt;Random Jerk Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- this is it. this is the best one. combines nearly all the others to give you a random NPC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=n7pkAqQ1&#34;&gt;Random Gun Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=k0JgCYj0&#34;&gt;Random Weapon Generator&lt;/a&gt; - includes the above (somewhat rarely) and also melee weapons etc&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- creates some truly ridiculous shit, much funnier if you know anything about guns and how bad of an idea it would be to build.. pretty much anything that this spits out&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- of note: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;jury-rigged&amp;rdquo; firearms would crit fail on rolls of 1-3 and then you rolled for them to explode (low chance), break (high chance), or jam (about even with break)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;average quality&amp;rdquo; would crit fail on rolls of 1-2 and then explode (very low chance), break (medium chance), or jam (most of the time)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;professionally made&amp;rdquo; would only crit fail on rolls of 1 and never explode, rarely break&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=RrTCegHx&#34;&gt;Random Car Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- either this one or the gun one was the first one i made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- funnier if you know anything about cars&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=Gu9e4wZc&#34;&gt;Random Name Generator&lt;/a&gt; - content warning: capable of some problematic combinations. no slurs but there are a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of words in there.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=Cv3DSKd3&#34;&gt;Random &amp;ldquo;Cocktail&amp;rdquo; Generator&lt;/a&gt; - includes the random name generator, because they&amp;rsquo;re just as good as names for cocktails&lt;br&gt;
- people consider some truly desperate shit to be a &amp;ldquo;cocktail&amp;rdquo; in the post-apocalyptic wasteland, hence the scare quotes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=527Ced3V&#34;&gt;Random Outfit Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=dwSGNZ4C&#34;&gt;Random Food Generator&lt;/a&gt; - notable for the 2028-era &amp;ldquo;snack foods&amp;rdquo;, which i keep meaning to split into their own separate generator for this one to include but never got around to&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=wGDRXkxV&#34;&gt;Random Loot Generator&lt;/a&gt; - includes both of the above, but single clothing items rather than outfits, also includes a couple other generators (rarely) like the weapon one, the armor one, the implant one, maybe the car one i forget&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=LhAkMqA7&#34;&gt;Random Armor Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- includes some heavy clothing with no armor value as well, generates full &amp;ldquo;outerwear&amp;rdquo; outfits&amp;hellip; by apocalypse standards, anyway&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;generators---the-supplementalancillaryones&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GENERATORS - THE SUPPLEMENTAL/ANCILLARY ONES&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;#generators---the-supplementalancillaryones&#34; class=&#34;anchor&#34;&gt;🔗&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;these are mostly useful if you need a specific class of object, or as things that the other ones include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=796YGSZB&#34;&gt;Random Bag Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- pretty much the same as the Loot generator from the &amp;ldquo;best ones&amp;rdquo; section, but in a bag&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=LQ2EEze4&#34;&gt;Random Monster Generator&lt;/a&gt; - mutant animals&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=DVe8pAck&#34;&gt;Random Dog Generator&lt;/a&gt; - good dogs, often with tattoos, collars with names, mutations, implants, disabilities, or other things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=LRGxzeHP&#34;&gt;Random Haircut Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=iG2NzHh0&#34;&gt;Random Tattoo Generator&lt;/a&gt; - content warning: contains some nazi shit, because i wanted a shitty world where people would have tattoos of random pop culture stuff from the 2020s that they had absolutely zero context for&lt;br&gt;
- built to include in the Jerk generator, the tattoos ended up in the Dog generator as well. nightmarish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=L2yveMqz&#34;&gt;Random Implant Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=h9FejwBk&#34;&gt;Random Mutation Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=pbDa5Xus&#34;&gt;Random Disability Generator&lt;/a&gt; - content warning: no r-slur or anything but it&amp;rsquo;s a fraught topic.&lt;br&gt;
- built these all to include in the Jerk generator at the top (and also the Dog generator)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=YcUP03De&#34;&gt;Random Settlement Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- does what it says on the tin. useful for background when the party stumbled upon a building I decided should be occupied but didn&amp;rsquo;t have anything in mind&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=17tNFM3c&#34;&gt;Random Weather Generator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;
- built for the Encounter generator, but i think i actually ended up using it more on its own&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://orteil.dashnet.org/randomgen/?gen=WKUCM8FH&#34;&gt;Random Encounter Generator&lt;/a&gt; - includes the Jerk, Dog, Monster generators among others&lt;br&gt;
- sets the scene for an encounter. in practice i didn&amp;rsquo;t use this much, usually just picked stuff myself&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/110BKZlxkJQIFUqZoIQen_y9VTIR4jG2q/view&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-g53HZa5R-2Q/XnrDsOXZFjI/AAAAAAAAo38/07PnrEzi65o7a1AwvMBsBe3UyH3fBr3EwCLcBGAsYHQ/s400/Sovietspaceposters-67.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This Is Just To Say&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have written&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;the bad communist tabletop role-playing game&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;that was echoing within&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_the empty chambers _&lt;em&gt;of my skull&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and which&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_you were probably hoping _ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;_would remain safely contained _ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;therein&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forgive me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;you can fly a space plane&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;and it would not let me rest&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;until I had released it upon the world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;- William Carlos Williams, probably&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Specifically I wrote this in like 2018 and just did the last 10% right now and have been persuaded—against my better judgement and thanks to the nefarious denizens of the OSR discord—to start a blog and it seemed like a good first post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can get it &lt;a href=&#34;https://drive.google.com/file/d/110BKZlxkJQIFUqZoIQen_y9VTIR4jG2q/view&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; on Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have run exactly one abortive play-testing campaign using this game and it was fun as hell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; If you&amp;rsquo;ve come here looking for fun things to steal, it has:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Communism!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A two-axis alignment system with mechanical effects!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classes that auto-succeed at things as their only ability!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vehicle rules!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A simple system for managing aerial dogfighting!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A system to create stats for pre-jet aircraft with just the input available from wikipedia!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
