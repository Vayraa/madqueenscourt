BATTLEFIRE ðŸ”—I mentioned it first a bit earlier, in this cosmology (sort of) post.Â If fire is the purest representation of Man&rsquo;s dominion over Nature, BATTLEFIRE is the purest representation of violence. It could also be described reasonably as a swirling rainbow vortex.
If you wield BATTLEFIRE, you have a pool of BATTLEFIRE Dice, Exploding, or BDE,Â which are d6s.</div>

The Civilized Lands ðŸ”—The Civilized Lands, from whence adventurers come to the Mountain,Â are dominated by two large culture-groups, each formed from several component polities.

It&rsquo;s really good. I played a test run. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to be a solo RPG, but the way the ghoul acts seemed so perfect for scripting that I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of it as one.</div>
