Satans. You meet them at crossroads - sometimes by chance, sometimes by design. They have something to offer you. You have something they want.
You can make a deal.
Meeting Satan ðŸ”—First of all, add &lsquo;satan at the crossroads&rsquo; to your encounter table, probably at one of the ends (snake eyes?). If you&rsquo;re not at a crossroads and you roll it, roll again - satans only ever appear at crossroads.</div>
