There&rsquo;s a trend, I think, of minimal classes. Minimal wizards, even. Or maybe there isn&rsquo;t, I don&rsquo;t know, I can&rsquo;t find the blogpost if there is one.
This is only tangentially related to that, at best.Â It&rsquo;s more closely related to this, perhaps. An attempt to distill down the essence of &lsquo;Fighter&rsquo;. Less fiddly than a FIGHTMASTER, less flashy than a wave-dancing samurai duelist, less setting-bound than a Gutter Knight.</div>

This is eminently false.
But in the service of accessibility and reducing the number of falsehoods that are present on this earth, I will explain.

The Civilized Lands ðŸ”—The Civilized Lands, from whence adventurers come toÂ the Mountain,Â are dominated by two large culture-groups, each formed from several component polities.

The Rangery ðŸ”—&lsquo;Ranger&rsquo; is an in-world title. Rangers are somewhat like a secret society, somewhat like a freelance intelligence agency. They exist in the largest cities and the most distant wastes; naturally, many of them have found their way to the Mountain.
All Rangers areÂ Made of Hooks, transformed into that shape through some arcane ritual initiation that has never been witnessed by an outsider.</div>

Definitions and Etymology ðŸ”—So, the term &ldquo;adventure&rdquo;. It doesn&rsquo;t normally - in real life - mean walking into a tomb and killing (or being killed by) skeletons, getting treasure, all the things we expect from a tabletop RPG &ldquo;adventure&rdquo;. It really just means, like, going somewhere. The going, that&rsquo;s the adventure, the exciting part. What you do when you actually get there is just&hellip; Work, usually. Sometimes hanging out.</div>
