<p>The <strong>Titans</strong> built the world by playing cards with a <strong>78-piece</strong> deck. When their game was finished, they scattered them in the deep places of the earth and left.</p>
<p>From the cards left on the surface sprang the <strong>people</strong> we know:</p>
<p><strong>Arcadians</strong><br>
The civilized folk of the lush heartland, bronze-skinned and compact. Their suit is <strong>diamonds</strong> and their metal <strong>gold</strong>. If you&rsquo;re an Arcadian then you can identify <a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/twenty-three-swords-ish.html"><strong>swords</strong></a> and other magical artefacts at a glance, and if your <strong>CHA</strong> is at least <strong>+1</strong> then you can speak and read all human languages.</p>
<p>        **Yemics<br>
**            The educated folk of the southeast oases, grey-skinned and sharp-featured. Their suit is <strong>clubs</strong> and their metal <strong>lead</strong>. If you&rsquo;re a Yemic then you can <strong>fight like a caged animal</strong> to make an extra melee attack at the cost of <strong>1 HP</strong>, and if your <strong>CHA</strong> is at least <strong>+1</strong> then you can subsist indefinitely on strong tea and tobacco.</p>
<p>**        Barbarians**<br>
            The savage folk of the northern tundra, ice-eyed and sturdy. Their suit is <strong>spades</strong> and their metal <strong>iron</strong>. If you&rsquo;re a barbarian then you have <strong>+1 to-hit</strong>, and if your <strong>CHA</strong> is at least <strong>+1</strong> then you&rsquo;re immune to <strong>weather</strong>.</p>
<p>        **Monkeys<br>
**            The arboreal folk of the southwest jungle, naked and hirsute. Their suit is **hearts **and their metal <strong>copper</strong>. If you&rsquo;re a monkey then you can hold things in your feet, do handstands, climb and jump real well and do all the other things a monkey is good at, and if your <strong>CHA</strong> is at least <strong>+1</strong> then you know sign language—which will come in handy, because you can&rsquo;t vocalize in human tongues.</p>
<p>            <strong>Bonus monkey table</strong><br>
    STR    Monkey<br>
                <strong>+4</strong>Gorilla<br>
                <strong>+2</strong>Chimpanzee, Orangutan, Bonobo   <br>
                <strong>+1</strong> Mandrill, Baboon, Gelada, Gibbon<br>
                <strong>+0</strong> Howler, Proboscis, Colobus, Spider, Woolly<br>
                <strong>-1</strong>  Macaque, Saki, Uakari, Langur, Douc<br>
                <strong>-2</strong>Snub-nosed, Talapoin, Tamarin, Lemur, Capuchin<br>
                <strong>-3</strong>Marmoset, Squirrel, Night, Tarsier</p>
<p>        **Snake People<br>
**            The inscrutable folk of the southern wetlands, green-skinned and hairless. Their suit is <strong>eyes</strong> and their metal <strong>mercury</strong>. If you&rsquo;re a snake person then you are immune to <strong>poison</strong>, and if your <strong>CHA</strong> is at least <strong>+1</strong> you can speak and understand the language of <strong>scaled things</strong>.</p>
<p>        **Horse People<br>
**            The nomadic folk of the northeast steppes, ruddy and lithe. Their suit is <strong>rings</strong> and their metal <strong>silver</strong>. If you&rsquo;re a horse person then you ignore <strong>range</strong> penalties to-hit, and if your <strong>CHA</strong> is at least <strong>+1</strong> then <strong>dumb animals</strong> will treat you, personally, as a friend.</p>
<p>        **Rock People who became Dwarfs<br>
**            The industrialized people of the mountains, originally from the northwest where there is now only ash, who have excised a part of themselves and become something less than human. They have no suit, and their metal is <strong>uranium</strong> which is also called <strong>adamant</strong>. I don&rsquo;t think you can be a dwarf.</p>
<p>Nobody knows from whence came the <strong>Elfs</strong> (powerful, individual, capricious) and the <strong>Leeches</strong> (rain-slick, blind, hungry).</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naFnupctNYw/YSQul_LL5ZI/AAAAAAAAuxA/GZuLPZ9q7jYa7y4bT9MnQGno37qlXKQrACLcBGAsYHQ/s1024/BLACK%2BSTAR%2Bsuits.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-naFnupctNYw/YSQul_LL5ZI/AAAAAAAAuxA/GZuLPZ9q7jYa7y4bT9MnQGno37qlXKQrACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h640/BLACK%2BSTAR%2Bsuits.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>From the <strong>aces</strong>, each placed on a mountaintop, were born the <strong>sacred metals</strong> of earth:</p>
<p>        **Lead<br>
**            The basest metal, inert and dead. <strong>Lead</strong> attracts and consumes magic, and can be used as a spiritual protectant or insulator. It is dull and heavy, a dark mirror of its brother <strong>Gold</strong>, and has few adherents but the dead. Those few it counts among the living wear blue, are expected to hunt Wizards, and wander.</p>
<p>        **Copper<br>
**            The dog of metals, the mother of <strong>Iron</strong>. <strong>Copper</strong> is helpful and easy to work. Pragmatic and simple and beautiful in her way, she is man&rsquo;s best friend. Her adherents wear red and green, are expected to feed the hungry and shelter the poor, and are common in all territories of Man and Monkey.</p>
<p>        <strong>Iron</strong></p>
<p>            A grim substance, <strong>Iron</strong> severs the souls of those he contacts. He is a hateful thing, and means destruction, and those slain by him rise as <strong>undead</strong> when exposed to moonlight. His adherents wear ash-grey, are expected to destroy icons and proselytize, and are common in the land of Yem.</p>
<p>        **Silver<br>
**            The touch of <strong>Silver</strong> burns away curses, disease, and other maladies, and is a toxin to the <strong>undead</strong> and other monsters. She is known as the holiest of metals. Her adherents wear black, are expected to tend the dying and judge the guilty, and wander.</p>
<p>        <strong>Mercury</strong></p>
<p>Bold and capricious, <strong>Quicksilver</strong> is liquid at ambient pressure and temperature, and toxic to Monkeys and most species of Man. Their adherents—among the Snake People and <strong>Elfs</strong> who can safely handle them—wear white, and are expected to use drugs and meditation to achieve higher states of being.</p>
<p>        <strong>Gold</strong></p>
<p>            The lord of metals, <strong>Gold</strong> is most prized and studied among his kind. He is intimately connected to royalty, and accumulates spiritual weight when exposed to blood or violence. When possessed, he attaches to the soul of his bearer and adds his weight to theirs. His adherents wear purple, are expected to accumulate power at any cost, and can be found anywhere there is something to gain.</p>

<p>Legend holds that the <strong>First King Prometheus</strong> unearthed the <strong>King of Eyes</strong> from its hiding place deep beneath the earth in ages long since past, thus bringing the curse of <strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html">Kings</a></strong> upon Mankind. Legend also holds that he was devoured by his <strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/steel-shod-and-nostrils-flaring-class.html">knights</a></strong> for this crime, and his bones interred in the distant northwest before it became a land of ash and folly.</p>
<p>As for the truth, well, perhaps there&rsquo;s a hole you can die in attempting to figure it out.</p>
