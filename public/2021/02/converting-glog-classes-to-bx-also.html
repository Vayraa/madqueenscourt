This is eminently false.

<p>It has come to my attention that some people don&rsquo;t understand how to play GLOG classes in B/X (or OSE, as the case may be). They labor under the mistaken assumption that you have to &ldquo;convert&rdquo; them, and need &ldquo;guidance&rdquo; to do so.</p>
<p><strong>This is eminently false.</strong></p>
<p>But in the service of accessibility and reducing the number of falsehoods that are present on this earth, I will explain.</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-have-to-convert-them-at-all">You don&rsquo;t have to convert them at all. <a href="#you-dont-have-to-convert-them-at-all" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p>That&rsquo;s pithy, but almost true. More accurately, the conversion is one step in the simplest cases, and like, three in the most complex:</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eM27nTEYM0U/YDaehE7duiI/AAAAAAAAq1Q/6riKu8iVzmkOFqlsefdYlQ6jXzzCiZSNwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1131/Screenshot%2B2021-02-24%2B104402.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eM27nTEYM0U/YDaehE7duiI/AAAAAAAAq1Q/6riKu8iVzmkOFqlsefdYlQ6jXzzCiZSNwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h230/Screenshot%2B2021-02-24%2B104402.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><em><a href="http://wizzzargh.blogspot.com/">Wizzzargh</a> is talking about BFRPG, not B/X, but the same principles apply. Also I played in their game; it worked just fine.</em></p>
<h2 id="here-i-will-give-you-some-examples">Here, I will give you some examples. <a href="#here-i-will-give-you-some-examples" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DzU0QLWHz-g/YDaif6PUGQI/AAAAAAAAq1s/3IuQWRfLh00s_fm5RJDWz4HcCS7WgVrKACLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-DzU0QLWHz-g/YDaif6PUGQI/AAAAAAAAq1s/3IuQWRfLh00s_fm5RJDWz4HcCS7WgVrKACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/fighter.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p><em>This is a class from the inimitable <a href="https://dungeonantology.com/">Jojiro</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://jojiro.itch.io/red-box-rogues">Red Box Rogues</a>. It doesn&rsquo;t matter what B/X source you use, this works fine with the OSE classic 4 classes or whatever.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a B/X class, right? Warm. Safe. Comfortable.</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s say, hypothetically, for the sake of argument, that our pl*yers (base and loathsome creatures that they are) want to play something cool and interesting instead. Let&rsquo;s say they want to playÂ <a href="https://arrogantwizard.blogspot.com/2019/12/you-sprout-bouquet-of-gun-wielding-arms.html">Shivas of Gunses</a>. We&rsquo;re using this as an example because it&rsquo;s exceptionally weird, being fighter-y but also wizard-y. If you can convert this, you can convert anything.</p>
<p>Excellent.Â </p>
<p><strong>Step Zero:</strong> Remove all the stuff you&rsquo;re going to change. In this case, a complex one, we&rsquo;re cutting fucking everything.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3hYbNoXhT1k/YDavCyrPyMI/AAAAAAAAq2E/Pba54-5pK9EyPr_lFtv5RcHfVAQ_ciQNwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter2.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3hYbNoXhT1k/YDavCyrPyMI/AAAAAAAAq2E/Pba54-5pK9EyPr_lFtv5RcHfVAQ_ciQNwCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/fighter2.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Step one (optional):</strong>Â <strong>If</strong> you&rsquo;re combining classes, put the combined elements in there. I think Shivas of Guns should have <strong>Magic-User</strong> experience/level and HD, since they do spells sort of;Â <strong>Thief</strong> saves, armor proficiency, and prime requisite, since they&rsquo;re nimble; and <strong>Guns</strong> as a weapon proficiency,Â for obvious reasons. If you&rsquo;re converting something that&rsquo;s more obviously &ldquo;just a wizard&rdquo; or &ldquo;just a fighter&rdquo; or whatever, <strong>you can skip this step</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Step One (Point Five):</strong> This is also a good time to put the name of the class in.</p>
<p>This is what we&rsquo;ve got so far:</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IMTw7CZh000/YDax0sj0heI/AAAAAAAAq2U/qagj9N8VNlwSpsFLkjbHDvU6tpoorceKQCLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter3.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IMTw7CZh000/YDax0sj0heI/AAAAAAAAq2U/qagj9N8VNlwSpsFLkjbHDvU6tpoorceKQCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h456/fighter3.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Step Two (Mandatory):</strong>Â Put all the abilities of the GLOG class in, converting references to <strong>templates</strong>Â to references to <strong>level</strong>Â as you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oUwRaJjZbhk/YDa2xRotOBI/AAAAAAAAq2c/dswut10EgSUmcGqbipUB3d602AHdAoAiACLcBGAsYHQ/s1093/fighter3.png"><img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-oUwRaJjZbhk/YDa2xRotOBI/AAAAAAAAq2c/dswut10EgSUmcGqbipUB3d602AHdAoAiACLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h416/fighter3.png" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Bam! And we made a whole fancy layout that we didn&rsquo;t need, even. This is a simple enough process that you can honestly just write down:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>SHIVA OF GUNS<br>
PRIME REQ:</strong>Â DEX<br>
<strong>ARMOR:</strong> LEATHER, NO SHIELDS<br>
<strong>WEAPONS:</strong> GUNS, KNIVES<br>
<strong>HD/EXP:</strong> AS M-U<br>
<strong>THAC0:</strong> AS FIGHTER<br>
<strong>SAVES:</strong> AS THIEF</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hell, for most classes you can cut that down to one line: <strong>STUFF:</strong> AS <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Â </p>
<p>And would you look at that, we&rsquo;re done!</p>
