        <p>In the distant, foreign land that is the past, <a href="http://monstermanualsewnfrompants.blogspot.com/2014/11/this-is-not-that-list-of-questions-for.html">Scrap Princess wrote a list of 20 setting questions</a>.</p>
<p>This is not that list. I like that list a lot but honestly they aren&rsquo;t all questions that I would ask as a player. This list <em>is</em>Â that - if I&rsquo;m going to play in your game, I want you to answer these. I did try to channel the aesthetic of that list, though.</p>
<h2 id="here-are-the-questions">Here are the questions: <a href="#here-are-the-questions" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><strong>1) What class knows the most martial arts? Are they real martial arts like kung fu, or made up ones like krav maga?</strong></p>
<p><strong>2) Can I start out having already made a deal with the devil or do I have to do that in game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>3) Do you want me to write an 8-page backstory? Can I write an 8-page backstory, if I want to? If I write something down in it like I&rsquo;m the timelost princess of the brass city and the daughter of the sun and I commanded legions in the Hell War but was betrayed by my father&rsquo;s vizier but I don&rsquo;t know that, or that I&rsquo;m elf conan and cooler than everyone else, will that be true?</strong></p>
<p><strong>4) If I eat someone&rsquo;s heart, will I gain their powers? What about their brain?</strong></p>
<p><strong>5) These classes are boring, can I be one from somewhere else? What about from a different system entirely?</strong></p>
<p><strong>6) If I make a sword, which one of us gets to name it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>7) Am I allowed to kill the other player characters? What would I have to do to be allowed to? Do I win if I kill them all? Actually, how do I win in general?</strong></p>
<p><strong>8) What language stands in for &lsquo;Common&rsquo;? Or what are we all talking to each other in? Like the party, mostly, but also everyone else?</strong></p>
<p><strong>9) How do I learn how to talk to rocks? No not once a day just, like, normally?</strong></p>
<p><strong>10) Which kinds of wizards get to serve kings and live in towers and shit and which ones are run out of town or stoned to death in the streets? Can I be both? At the same time?</strong></p>
<p>Some people have <em>already</em>Â answered these, incredibly:</p>

<h2 id="and-here-they-are-again-because-i-should-probably-answer-them-myself"><strong>And here they are again, because I should probably answer them myself:</strong> <a href="#and-here-they-are-again-because-i-should-probably-answer-them-myself" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h2><p><strong>1) What class knows the most martial arts? Are they real martial arts like kung fu, or made up ones like krav maga?</strong></p>
<p>I think the class that knows the most made up martial arts and the most martial arts in general has to be the Templar Contemplative, or &ldquo;paladin monk&rdquo; if you&rsquo;re crude. It&rsquo;s in theÂ <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-players-handbook.html">Mountain PHB</a>. The one that knows the most real martial arts (historical european ones, I suppose) would be the <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html">FIGHTMASTER</a>.</p>
<p>If you count <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html">BATTLEMAGES</a>, I guess they each know a made up one too.</p>
<p><strong>2) Can I start out having already made a deal with the devil or do I have to do that in game?</strong></p>
<p>You could definitely argue that (true) Witches (they&rsquo;re in the PHB, I&rsquo;m not linking it again) have already made deals with devils, or similar beings. If you don&rsquo;t want to be a Witch, you&rsquo;ll have to make one with a <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/mountain-satans-at-crossroads.html">Satan</a> in-game. You can find them at any crossroad, but only sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>3) Do you want me to write an 8-page backstory? Can I write an 8-page backstory, if I want to? If I write something down in it like I&rsquo;m the timelost princess of the brass city and the daughter of the sun and I commanded legions in the Hell War but was betrayed by my father&rsquo;s vizier but I don&rsquo;t know that, or that I&rsquo;m elf conan and cooler than everyone else, will that be true?</strong></p>
<p>Not particularly but I&rsquo;d be flattered as long as you&rsquo;re aware that you might die; yes sure if you&rsquo;d like; the planar stuff is a no-go but elaborate backstories that set you up as a Person of Importance are totally fine.</p>
<p><strong>4) If I eat someone&rsquo;s heart, will I gain their powers? What about their brain?</strong></p>
<p>If they&rsquo;re magic or you&rsquo;re magic, probably. If they&rsquo;re magic <em>and</em>Â you&rsquo;re magic, with 100% certainty. Spellcasters eating each others&rsquo; brains for power is even in the <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/glog-grog.html">core rules</a>.</p>
<p><strong>5) These classes are boring, can I be one from somewhere else? What about from a different system entirely?</strong></p>
<p>Not if you&rsquo;re the very first round of characters, I&rsquo;ve invested too much in my <em>theme</em>Â and <em>tone</em>Â to see it spurned like that. And also it would sort of ruin the &lsquo;unlocking&rsquo; aspect of play. If you want to see a class in the game, though, you tell me about it and I&rsquo;ll tell you what you&rsquo;d have to do to unlock it. I can probably adapt from anything else pretty easily, too.</p>
<p><strong>6) If I make a sword, which one of us gets to name it?</strong></p>
<p>I do, unless you have a <em>really</em>Â good idea. Swords are not named by their creators, they tell their creators their names. Unless you&rsquo;re a god or something, then I guess you can name it.</p>
<p><strong>7) Am I allowed to kill the other player characters? What would I have to do to be allowed to? Do I win if I kill them all? Actually, how do I win in general?</strong></p>
<p>No. You win by resolving the question of why you&rsquo;re all on the <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/mountain-setting-precis.html">Mountain</a>, and why the Sun went out, and why people get horrible visions of great birds on wings of ash and bone issuing forth from its depths and its peak.</p>
<p><strong>8) What language stands in for &lsquo;Common&rsquo;? Or what are we all talking to each other in? Like the party, mostly, but also everyone else?</strong></p>
<p>Trader&rsquo;s Cant, a sort of pidgin tongue that everyone who is anyone knows how to speak. Not great for complex wordplay.</p>
<p><strong>9) How do I learn how to talk to rocks? No not once a day just, like, normally?</strong></p>
<p>If you have an intelligence bonus, you can start out with that. Well, not rocks specifically, they&rsquo;re too stupid. But there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html">language</a> for gems and treasure, and one for swords, and one for bugs, and&hellip;</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t have an intelligence bonus you can probably still learn, but it&rsquo;d be more of an undertaking.</p>
<p><strong>10) Which kinds of wizards get to serve kings and live in towers and shit and which ones are run out of town or stoned to death in the streets? Can I be both? At the same time?</strong></p>
<p>There are proper Wizards back in the civilized lands, I think, but you can&rsquo;t be one of those, you&rsquo;re too poor and crazy to be one and/or they&rsquo;re too sane and well-compensated to come to the Mountain. Your options are Witches, which are solidly in the &ldquo;run out of town&rdquo; category, andÂ <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-4th-battlemages-class-fighter.html">BATTLEMAGES</a>, which probably <em>should</em>Â be run out of town but who&rsquo;s gonna do it, huh?</p>
