<p>Class: Ultimate Thief</p>
<p>Every template of Thief you have gives you <strong>+1 to sneaking</strong>, <strong>stealing</strong>, and <strong>saves</strong>. Your second and fourth templates also each give you <strong>+1 to-hit</strong>. If you&rsquo;re playing in a system with <strong>proficiency</strong>, you have it in <strong>light</strong> armor and any type of weapon that can be both wielded in one hand and concealed under a light jacket.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong> Stealth and <strong>see template A</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong> A <strong>knife</strong>, a <strong>light weapon</strong> of your choice and <strong>ammunition</strong> for it if applicable, a <strong>thieves tool</strong>, <strong>dark clothing</strong>, a <strong>bullseye lantern</strong> and <strong>oil</strong>, <strong>soft boots</strong>, and a <strong>cloak</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong> Scraps, Skilled, Stolen Fortunes<br>
<strong>B</strong> Connected, Hidden Pockets, +1 Skill, +1 FD<br>
<strong>C</strong> Opportunist, +1 Skill, +1 FD<br>
<strong>D</strong> Shadow, +1 Skill, +1 FD</p>
<p><strong>A: Scraps</strong><br>
A life spent eating scraps and fleeing from the cops has left you frail and sickly, giving you <strong>-1 HP</strong> per <strong>HD.</strong></p>
<p><strong>A: Skilled</strong><br>
A thief lives or dies by their skills, and by surviving this long you&rsquo;ve already picked up a much broader repertoire than most adventurers—as well as some special tricks. <strong>Twice</strong> upon gaining this template as well as <strong>once</strong> for each thief template thereafter, gain a skill from the list downbelow. In addition, you gain the <strong>special ability</strong> from the list for each skill on it that you have.</p>
<p><strong>A: Stolen Fortunes</strong><br>
You have a pool of <strong>Fortune Dice</strong>, or <strong>FD</strong>, which are <strong>d4</strong>s equal to the number of thief templates you have. You can roll any number of these when you roll a <strong>d20</strong>, and add them to the result. <strong>FD</strong> that come up a result less than or equal to the number of <strong>FD</strong> you rolled are expended until you get a good long rest, otherwise they return to your pool.</p>
<p><strong>B: Connected</strong><br>
Whatever organization, underworld, community, or creed you belong to is connected to people and places everywhere, and there are signs by which you may recognize and be recognized as a part of the same. When you roll a natural <strong>7</strong> on a <strong>reaction</strong> roll, reroll it and the encounter is in some way connected to your background.</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> <strong>Hidden Pockets</strong><br>
You have <strong>[templates]</strong> extra inventory slots. Items you store in them can&rsquo;t be found by anyone unless you want them to.</p>
<p><strong>C: Opportunist</strong><br>
When fighting an opponent who can&rsquo;t pay full attention to you—because they&rsquo;ve got sand or sun in their eyes, they&rsquo;re being flanked, you yelled &ldquo;hey what&rsquo;s that over there&rdquo; and they&rsquo;re an idiot, &amp;c—your attacks deal <strong>double</strong> damage.</p>
<p><strong>D: Shadow</strong><br>
You can <strong>vanish</strong> in shadows, do loud things (running, fighting, breaking stuff) <strong>very</strong> quietly, and do quiet things (walking, climbing, pulling a knife, rummaging around in a backpack) in <strong>absolute</strong> silence. </p>

<p>1d20 Thief Skills</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Locksmithing</strong><br>
When you successfully pick a lock, it&rsquo;s instantaneous. When you fail, it only takes a round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Jury-rigging</strong><br>
Improvised or makeshift tools and devices function as well as professionally made ones, in your hands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Climbing</strong><br>
You can climb sheer surfaces as if they were merely difficult, even without gear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Acrobatics</strong><br>
You can dodge over, around, and effectively <em>through</em> people and person-scale obstacles as if they weren&rsquo;t even there, as long as there&rsquo;s room to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html">Burglary</a></strong><br>
Given ten minutes per hundred square feet, you can pile everything vaguely saleable - including hidden objects, parts of other objects, et cetera - in the middle of a room.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**Appraisal<br>
**You can determine the value of objects to within one order of magnitude at a glance, and identify them precisely with between one minute and one hour of study depending on scale.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forgery</strong><br>
You can forge believable documents, signatures, et cetera without an original to examine, provided you&rsquo;ve seen one before or have a halfway decent description to work from.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disguise</strong><br>
When disguised as someone, you count <em>as them</em> for any magical or metaphysical purposes. If it matters, you can also mimic their iris patterns, fingerprints, blood type, &amp;c.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Forensics</strong><br>
When examining the scene of an event, you can physically <em>see and hear</em> an approximation of how the event played out. This won&rsquo;t necessarily give you any new information, but it will certainly make clues obvious that might otherwise have been missed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Anatomy</strong><br>
When presented with an unaware subject that possesses a comprehensible anatomy, you can place them in whatever state you desire with a nerve pinch/karate chop/stiff-knuckled jab to the pressure points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fast-talking</strong><br>
Potential interlocutors must check <strong>morale</strong> to interrupt or disbelieve you as long as you keep talking. You can speak for a full thirty seconds without running out of breath.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Devices</strong><br>
You can alter or repair <strong>devices</strong> effectively even without appropriate tools. When you <strong>sabotage</strong> a device, you can choose exactly what time or condition under which it will fail and the manner in which it will do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Toxicology</strong><br>
You can determine the nature of a poisoning from symptoms without risk of error, and can formulate a reasonably effective poison or antidote from any well-stocked pantry or acre of wilderness.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Linguistics</strong><br>
Through roguish instinct, you know how to say all of the following in any language that you&rsquo;ve heard spoken even once:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want any trouble&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;How can I get <em>fucked up</em> around here?&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;I have the money, if you have the stuff&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;This is [a] robbery!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my wife!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&ldquo;COPS!&rdquo;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Smuggling</strong><br>
Once per locale, you can have had a <strong>connection</strong> smuggle something helpful in for you. The <strong>DM</strong> gets to decide what exactly it is (which you do not know) and where exactly it&rsquo;s placed (which you do).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html"><strong>Intimidation</strong></a><br>
Your threats are always treated as credible and requiring <strong>morale</strong> checks by anything that can understand them. You could bop a dragon on the shin and say &ldquo;eeeeeehhh nice pile of treasure you got here, be a shame if something happened to it&rdquo; and they would have to make a <strong>morale</strong> check. Dragons have very, very high <strong>morale</strong> scores, but they still have to make the check.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Fencing</strong><br>
You have a <strong>2-in-6</strong> chance of finding a buyer for stolen goods in any settlement, a <strong>2-in-6</strong> chance of knowing if any given buyer is going to rat you out, and a <strong>2-in-6</strong> chance of disarming your opponent in a flashy <em>prise de fer</em> with the first attack you make in each combat.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pickpocketing</strong><br>
When someone tries to wield an item you have a <strong>2-in-6</strong> chance of having already stolen it, if you&rsquo;ve been within arm&rsquo;s reach of them within the last hour and should so desire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drinking</strong><br>
You can identify special properties of beverages accurately by taste. When blackout drunk, you only do <strong>cool</strong> shit, no embarrassing shit, unless it&rsquo;s also super <strong>cool</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eavesdropping</strong><br>
When you listen in on a conversation, the participants are <strong>guaranteed</strong> to speak about something of interest to you.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="but-vayra-you-hate-generic-classes">But Vayra, You Hate Generic Classes <a href="#but-vayra-you-hate-generic-classes" class="anchor">🔗</a></h2><p>haha you know what it is</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://falseidolstla.blogspot.com/2021/06/vain-sword-salt-and-stars-edition.html">Pirate</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>cutlass</strong>, a <strong>pistol</strong> and powder and <strong>10</strong> balls, a jug of <strong>rum</strong>, a <strong>leather</strong> greatcoat, and all the rest but no dark clothing.<br>
Benefit: You can climb and swing on rigging, ropes, and chandeliers like a <strong>monkey</strong>, and foes in battle must check <strong>morale</strong> when you swash your buckle.<br>
Drawback: <strong>Wanted</strong> by all courts of the sea and a few of the land. If caught, you will be hung.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>**<a href="https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2020/02/thieves-guilds.html">Courtesan</a><br>
**Starting Equipment:Three sets of <strong>fine clothing</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong>, not armor), three <strong>fine</strong> <strong>stilettos</strong>, three grams of <strong>fine cocaine</strong>, three palettes of <strong>fine makeup</strong>, three pieces of <strong>fine jewelry</strong> (worth <strong>100sp</strong> each), none of the rest of that nonsense.<br>
Benefit:When you speak to someone who isn&rsquo;t hostile to you and could conceivably be romantically interested, you can keep them engaged for <strong>1d6 hours</strong> to the exclusion of all else.<br>
Drawback:You have the romantic interest of <strong>1d3</strong> powerful, distasteful, and inconvenient suitors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-modern-fiddly-firearms.html">Gunshow Detective</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>modern semi-automatic rifle</strong> and <strong>one full magazine</strong>, both of which have definitely been used in at least one murder. A <strong>police</strong> badge. Some uninteresting clothes. Nothing else.<br>
Benefit:You have <strong>to-hit</strong> with firearms as if you were a <strong>fighter</strong>. You can infer weapon name and stats from spent bullets and/or brass.<br>
Drawback: The sound of gunfire that isn&rsquo;t yours causes you to <strong>save</strong> vs. <strong>fear</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/11/a-hired-dick-glog-class-thief-guild.html">Gumshoe Detective</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>leather</strong> trench coat,a battered <strong>fedora</strong> or <strong>trilby</strong>, a <strong>hip flask</strong> full of good, cheap whiskey, an equally battered, good, and cheap <strong>revolver</strong>, one <strong>cartridge</strong>, <strong>20</strong> slightly squashed <strong>cigarettes</strong>, alcohol dependency, debt.<br>
Benefit:You can consider any number of <strong>clues</strong>, <strong>personal possessions</strong>, and/or <strong>the city</strong> for one full minute to determine how they are connected.<br>
Drawback:Each time you do the above you have a <strong>[things]-in-6</strong> chance of coming down with a splitting migraine that prevents you from doing anything useful until you get a good rest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html">Thug</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>blunt object</strong>, a <strong>white undershirt</strong> and <strong>black pants</strong>, a <strong>four-pack of tallboys</strong>, a <strong>20-pack of 100&rsquo;s</strong>, <strong>ominous tattoos</strong>, a <strong>burner cellphone</strong>, absolutely nothing else.<br>
Benefit:When you <strong>intimidate</strong> an NPC, they get a penalty to their <strong>morale</strong> check equal to the number of the following things that are true: You broke something of their in front of them; you mentioned a specific, non-obvious fact about them; you came up with a good in-character threat; you confronted them somewhere they thought was safe.<br>
Drawback: You are always assumed to be the person of least importance, unless an action hero is fighting you, in which case they&rsquo;ll take you out first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html">Gentleman Thief</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>domino mask</strong>, a <strong>nice suit</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong>, not armor), twenty <strong>calling cards</strong> (design them in <strong>photoshop</strong>, <strong>ms paint</strong>, or another <strong>image manipulation program</strong>), none of that other garbage.<br>
Benefit:Your <strong>calling cards</strong> count as invitations to the most exclusive clubs and parties, can automatically get you out of minor punishments with a minimum of embarrassment, and - once per settlement - excuse you from a death penalty in favor of permanent exile.<br>
Drawback:At some point or when you reach template <strong>D</strong> (whichever happens first) the rest of your line will perish, leaving you with an <strong>estate</strong> in the city, an <strong>estate</strong> in the country, a <strong>yacht</strong>, a <strong>ski lodge</strong>, a <strong>crypt</strong>, at least three <strong>dark secrets</strong>, 15,000 gp in <strong>gambling arrears</strong>, and any other grudges your family is owed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/05/thief-guilds-of-blessed-city.html">Dagger Cultist</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:Six <strong>daggers</strong>, a <strong>sash</strong> and <strong>sheath</strong> for each dagger, light and loose <strong>ramie</strong> clothing, the lantern, boots, and cloak you are owed.<br>
Benefit:When you whisper the <strong>true name</strong> of a target to your knives, they automatically hit it when thrown. If you didn&rsquo;t already speak <strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html">swordsong</a></strong> you do now, and short blades speak more intelligently to you than they do to others.<br>
Drawback:You sprout visible horns and/or antennae according to your power. If you do, you may be <strong>executed</strong> as a witch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2020/02/thieves-guilds.html">Archaeologist</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:Your <strong>knife</strong>, a <strong>S&amp;W M1917 .45 ACP revolver</strong> and <strong>6 cartridges</strong> in a moon clip, a <strong>leather</strong> bullwhip, <strong>leather</strong> vest, and <strong>leather</strong> hat, the lantern and boots you demand, and no cloak.<br>
Benefit: You can tell when things belong in a museum (exceptionally ancient, powerful, or valuable) at a glance. If someone could know a historically relevant fact, you&rsquo;re that someone.<br>
Drawback:When it would be least convenient (to you) and most funny (to the DM), you have a <strong>1-in-6</strong> (exploding) chance of discovering snakes, which terrify and upset you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Assassin</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>cool spring-loaded wrist blade</strong> or an <strong>elegantly curved dagger</strong> (your choice), a loaded <strong>two-shot derringer</strong>, a <strong>smoke bomb</strong>, and your clothing, lantern, et cetera.<br>
Benefit:You can line up lethal shots against distant unaware targets without a roll, as if you were right next to them. If you want it, there&rsquo;s always <strong>work</strong> available.<br>
Drawback: Your order will <strong>require</strong> you to take on certain jobs. Failure would be&hellip; unwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Revolutionary</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>monkey wrench</strong>, an <strong>iron bomb</strong>, three <strong>molotov cocktails</strong>, a <strong>red bandana</strong>, your clothes and lantern and such.<br>
Benefit:Given an economy with significant wealth inequality, one hour, and a soapbox to speak from, you can cause significant unrest among the lower classes. Make a <strong>reaction</strong> roll to determine how well you are able to direct their ire.<br>
Drawback:<strong>-2 reaction</strong> with other <strong>revolutionaries</strong> (due to leftist infighting) and <strong>agents of authority</strong> (for obvious reasons) as long as your identity is known. Both of the above will pen screeds and tirades against you and have them delivered to you by messenger.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cat Burglar</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat%27s_paw_(nail_puller)">cat&rsquo;s paw</a></strong>, a pair of <strong>razor-clawed gloves</strong>, a small (cat-sized) <strong>burlap sack</strong>, a <strong>cat</strong>, dark clothing, soft boots, no lantern.<br>
Benefit:You can see by starlight as if it were daylight, climb and balance like a <strong>cat</strong>, and pounce about fifteen feet when making an attack.<br>
Drawback:Slit pupils and twitchy, furred ears and tail mark you as some sort of horrible mutant. You have a <strong>prey scent</strong> and will be attacked immediately by large predators and prioritized as a target by foes with strong aesthetic sensibilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kingnapper</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A crudely forged <strong>iron dagger</strong>, enough <strong>stout hemp rope</strong> to bind a king, a large (king-sized) <strong>burlap sack</strong>, clothes and lantern and such.<br>
Benefit:You can carry <strong>one</strong>securely bound person in a sack as easily as if they were, I don&rsquo;t know, a <strong>3 slot</strong> sack of potatoes.<br>
Drawback: You&rsquo;re responsible for the care and feeding of any king you kingnap. Allowing one to die in your care will see you hunted to the ends of the earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Skaven">Sewer</a> <a href="https://leagueoflegends.fandom.com/wiki/Twitch">Rat</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>viciously hooked cutlass</strong>, a <strong>repeating crossbow</strong> and <strong>20 bolts</strong>, a <strong>gas mask</strong>, clothes and cloak and lamp and whatnot.<br>
Benefit: You can speak <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/04/1d20-fantasy-languages.html"><strong>chew</strong></a> if you couldn&rsquo;t already, and summon <strong>[minutes spent chanting]^2</strong> rats with a secret incantation, up to the number of rats reasonably present wherever you are. They aren&rsquo;t automatically obedient, roll <strong>reaction</strong> as normal.<br>
Drawback:The stench of the sewers is permanently upon you, and it is <strong>gross</strong>. If you ever manage to scrub it off, you lose your rat-summoning powers and rats won&rsquo;t talk to you until you get good and grimy again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Aerialist</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:** 100&rsquo;** of high-quality silk, assorted <strong>swivels</strong>, <strong>carabiners</strong> and <strong>clips</strong>, an elaborately tasseled <strong>jian</strong>, none of that other trash.<br>
Benefit:You weigh about a third as much as you would if you weren&rsquo;t an <strong>aerialist</strong>, and can swing from silks, vines, rigging, kites, and chandeliers like a <strong>monkey</strong>. Treat falls as though they were <strong>20&rsquo;</strong> shorter than they actually are.<br>
Drawback:Hollow bird bones break easily, giving you <strong>-2 HP</strong> per <strong>HD</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/04/there-are-four-dice-glog-class-wizard.html">Secret</a> <a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/10/glogtober-8th-mysteries-and-baited-hooks.html">Agent</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>silenced small-caliber pistol</strong> with <strong>one magazine</strong> and <strong>7 cartridges</strong>, a <strong>nice suit</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong>, not armor), a <strong>nice watch</strong>, a <strong>secret communication device</strong>.<br>
Benefit:You can <strong>call for backup</strong> to have a <strong>level</strong> <strong>1</strong> member of your organization with an appropriate class appear from an unlikely hiding spot to assist you with a single task. If you get them killed, Headquarters won&rsquo;t send you another one for <strong>1d6</strong> weeks.<br>
Drawback:Your organization will, naturally, give you <strong>tasks</strong> to accomplish in order to further their <strong>interests</strong> in the region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2020/06/glogmountain-fighters-and-rogues.html">Gambler</a></strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>loaded two-shot derringer</strong>, a <strong>straw boater</strong>, a <strong>nice suit</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong>, not armor), a cloak and a lamp and a whatnot.<br>
Benefit but also Drawback:When you succeed at a <strong>d20</strong> roll, you can choose to roll it again for <strong>double or nothing</strong>. A success on the second roll upgrades your result to that of a <strong>critical success</strong>, while a failure downgrades it to a <strong>fumble</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Escape Artist</strong><br>
_The Escape Artist has vanished from the confines of this blogpost. If any of you see it, please let me know.<a href="https://crateredland.blogspot.com/">Lexi</a> has found the Escape Artist. Here she is:<br>
_Starting Equipment:A set of <strong>lockpicks</strong>, a pot of <strong>grease</strong>, a <strong>catsuit</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong> <em>or</em> as <strong>leather</strong>, your choice), an incredibly valuable and even more <strong>incredibly stolen gemstone</strong>, twenty small and worthless <strong>signature trinkets</strong>, none of that other garbage.<br>
Benefit:You can squeeze through spaces slightly smaller than your head, and wriggle effortlessly free from <strong>mundane</strong> bonds.<br>
Drawback: You are compelled to leave your <strong>signature trinkets</strong> at the scene of every crime or other significant happening, to prove how much better you are than the authorities. You are pursued by a bumbling but persistent <strong>investigator</strong> (perhaps a <strong>gumshoe detective</strong>) who has staked their career and reputation on catching you; should they perish or be fired for their incompetence, you will receive a new one following the next time you leave a <strong>signature trinket</strong> somewhere.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>(Disgraced Former) Stage Magician</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:A <strong>nice suit</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong>, not armor), a <strong>very sharp hand-saw</strong>, a <strong>deck of trick playing cards</strong>, a <strong>deck of non-trick playing cards</strong>, a <strong>very tall hat</strong> with a <strong>false bottom</strong>, the <strong>top half of a rabbit</strong>.<br>
Benefit: You can cut willing (or unaware) people in half without killing them, which is very impressive.<br>
Drawback: <strong>1-in-6</strong> chance you can&rsquo;t put them back together 😳<br>
 </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mafioso</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:An <strong>M1921 Thompson Submachine Gun, Caliber .45</strong>, a <strong>drum magazine</strong>, and <strong>100 cartridges</strong>, a <strong>violin case</strong>, a <strong>nice suit</strong> (+1 <strong>reaction</strong>, not armor), a <strong>nice cigar</strong>, none of that other stuff.<br>
Benefit: You&rsquo;re part of a <em>famiglia</em>, and can scare up <strong>1d6 Little Italian Boys</strong> at a moment&rsquo;s notice plus travel time to and from <strong>Little Italy</strong>.<br>
Drawback:<strong>Little Italian Boys</strong> are a rowdy bunch, difficult to direct effectively. Until you&rsquo;ve reached template <strong>D</strong> (and become a <em>capo</em>), you must answer the call when <strong>1d6 Little Italian Boys</strong> are needed by another <strong>mafioso</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Shadowdancer</strong><br>
Starting Equipment:You just get the normal stuff, honestly.<br>
Benefit:You can step into any <strong>shadow</strong> and out of any other within a stone&rsquo;s throw (that you can see).<br>
Drawback:When you step through a <strong>shadow</strong> you have an <strong>X-in-6</strong> chance of losing a random item, where <strong>X</strong> is the number of times you&rsquo;ve stepped through <strong>shadows</strong> that day. You don&rsquo;t cast a **shadow **of your own.</p>
