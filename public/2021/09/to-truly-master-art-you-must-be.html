        <p>Â A base class forÂ <strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html">BLACK STAR OF THE CANNIBAL KINGS</a></strong>.

<h1 id="class-artist">Class: Artist <a href="#class-artist" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><blockquote>
<p><em>I consider the positions ofÂ <em><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/black-star-of-cannibal-kings-setting.html"><strong><em>Kings</em></strong></a></em>Â and rulers as that of dust motes. I observe treasures of gold and gems as so many bricks and pebbles. I look upon the finest silken robes as tattered rags. I see myriad worlds of the universe as small seeds of fruit, and the greatest lake as a drop of oil on my foot. I perceive the teachings of the world to be the illusion of magicians. I discern the highest conception of emancipation as a golden brocade in a dream, and view the holy path of the <strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-very-heart-and-substance-of-metal.html">sacred alchemists</a></strong> as flowers appearing in one&rsquo;s eyes. I see meditation as a pillar of a mountain, enlightenment as a nightmare in daytime. I look upon the judgment of right and wrong as the serpentine dance of a dragon, and the rise and fall of beliefs as but traces left by the four seasons.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You are a Wizard, a practitioner of a Secret Art, one who seeks after the secrets of the cosmosâ€”and has already learned more of them than is strictly good for a person. You have the same ability as the <strong><a href="https://madqueenscourt.blogspot.com/2021/08/the-very-heart-and-substance-of-metal.html">cleric</a></strong>Â to perceive the spirit world, but spend your <strong>Magician Dice</strong>Â to interact with it in a much more personal manner.Â You don&rsquo;t get any _directÂ _bonuses to-hit or anything like that, but read <strong>The Self Remade</strong>Â below.</p>
<p><strong>Skills:</strong>Â Esoteric History, Occultism, and one of <strong>1.</strong>Â AcrobaticsÂ <strong>2.</strong>Â MusicianshipÂ <strong>3.</strong>Â Alternative Medicine</p>
<p><strong>Starting Equipment:</strong>Â TwoÂ <strong>elaborate ornamental weapons</strong>Â of your choice, one slot full of <strong>muscle</strong>, <strong>sinew</strong>, or <strong>fat</strong>, martial artist&rsquo;s wrappings, simple robes, a pouch full of pre-fried flour, a canteen of water, one <strong>occult instrument</strong>Â from the list at the end.</p>
<p><strong>A</strong>Â The Self Remade, Secret Art, 1 MD<br>
<strong>B</strong>Â Dark Studies, Secret Tongue, +1 MD<br>
<strong>C</strong>Â The Art Realized, +1 MD<br>
<strong>D</strong>Â Mastery of Life and Death, +1 MD</p>
<p><strong>A: <a href="https://whosemeasure.blogspot.com/2021/08/seek-after-wizards-to-be-defiled-by.html">The Self Remade</a></strong><br>
You may fill up to <strong>[templates]</strong>Â inventory slots with <strong>muscle</strong>, <strong>sinew</strong>, or <strong>fat</strong>,Â through a day of focused effort (working out, stretching, eating a lot) per slot filled, emptied, or changed. Each slot of <strong>muscle</strong>Â grants you <strong>+1 STR</strong>, each slot of <strong>sinew</strong>Â grants you <strong>+1 DEX</strong>, and each slot of <strong>fat</strong>Â grants you <strong>one point of damage reduction</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>A: <a href="https://as-they-must.blogspot.com/2020/08/though-he-were-strong-as-seven-glog.html">Secret Art</a></strong><br>
You are almost a <strong>spellcaster</strong>, having the ability to see and communicate with the spirit world and a pool of <strong>Magician Dice</strong>Â which work very much like <strong>MD</strong>Â generally do, except you know no <strong>spells</strong>. Instead, you may decide before rolling to perform a feat of <strong>strength, agility, or endurance</strong> to add any number of <strong>MD</strong>, which exhaust just like they would when casting <strong>spells</strong>. When using <strong>MD</strong>Â in this way you may perform the feat with any part of your body; <strong>grappling</strong>Â with your bare feet, lifting heavy objects with one finger, etc.</p>
<p>You may define and name your Art, which will grant you a <strong>benefit</strong>Â and a <strong>drawback</strong>. Here are some examples, but feel free to make up your own with the <strong>GM&rsquo;s</strong>Â assistance.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>STITCH VEINS RED</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of the <strong>Queen-in-red</strong>. A careful style of barely-controlled momentum and frantic movement.</em><br>
Benefit:Â You may expend <strong>MD</strong>Â when touching a target to <strong>harm</strong>Â (requiring a successful <strong>unarmed attack</strong>) or <strong>heal</strong>Â them by <strong>[sum]</strong>.<br>
Drawback:Â Failing to honor a <strong>promise</strong>Â causes you to immediately roll all your <strong>MD</strong>Â (exhausting them as usual) and suffer the <strong>[sum]</strong>Â as damage - though this never causes <strong>serious wounds</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXCELLENCE IS UNATTAINABLE</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Judge Arbiter</strong>. A languid style that appears as drunken swaying to the uninitiated.</em><br>
Benefit:Â Those that interact directly with you treat allÂ <strong>critical successes</strong>Â as <strong>fumbles</strong>.<br>
Drawback:Â You treat all <strong>critical successes</strong>Â as regular rolls.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POISON NEEDLE HEART</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Witch-in-the-woods</strong>. An elegant, defensive style which is beautiful to observe.</em><br>
Benefit:Â Look into someone&rsquo;s eyes and roll opposed <strong>CHA</strong>. If you win, they obey a single not-obviously-suicidal command. If they win, they&rsquo;re immune. You win ties.<br>
Drawback:Â This is basically mind control and survivors will, once the command is discharged and they&rsquo;ve had at least a day to think about it, be appropriately horrified.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HUNDRED PACES LIGHTNING</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Nomad Inquisitor</strong>. An unassuming style with little grace but much power in its movements. Includes instruction in horse archery.</em><br>
Benefit:Â Once per round on your turn, you may transport yourself up to <strong>100&rsquo;</strong>Â in a flash of white light without spending an <strong>action</strong>.<br>
Drawback:Â You take <strong>1</strong> damage each time you do this, which is impossible to mitigate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EVERY TOWER FALLS</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Captain of Industry</strong>. A precise style with few applications outside of violence.</em><br>
Benefit:Â When you enter a fight, choose <strong>peace</strong>Â or <strong>violence</strong>. If you choose <strong>peace</strong>, youÂ gain <strong>[templates]</strong>Â points of damage reduction. If you choose <strong>violence</strong>, your attacks <strong>ignore armor</strong>Â and can, with effort, shatter stone.<br>
Drawback:Â When you choose <strong>peace</strong>, you become incapable of dealing direct damage. When you choose <strong>violence</strong>, attacks against you always hit.Â These effects last until the end of the fight and you may not switch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SIX POINT AMPHORA</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Madwoman Demagogue</strong>. A flowing, artful style which exhausts its users quickly.</em><br>
Benefit:Â You may edit your number of <strong>arms</strong> with an hourÂ of meditation. Your final number of <strong>limbs</strong> may not exceed <strong>6</strong>.<br>
Drawback:Â Each time you do this, take <strong>1d6</strong>Â damage. Walking around with a nonstandard body layout is considered freakish and undesirable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UNCARING DEPTHS ENFOLD</strong><br>
_Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Eternal Crone</strong>. An occult style whose practitioners appear to be in many places at once.Â _<br>
Benefit:Â You may roll <strong>CHA</strong>Â to order around creatures of the night (spiders, bats, black cats) and fish.<br>
Drawback:Â This does not convey the ability to converse with or understand them. They&rsquo;ll try their best to fulfill valid orders, but only have normal animal intelligence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BLUE FLAME HELLION</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Firebrand Vanguard</strong>. A vicious style incorporating powerful shouts and focused anger.</em><br>
Benefit:Â When you <strong>shout</strong>Â while making an attack, your hands and/or weapon become wreathed in crackling blue flames, deal an additional <strong>1d6</strong>Â damage, and <strong>ignite</strong>Â targets that fail a <strong>DEX</strong>Â check.<br>
Drawback:Â You take double damage from fire.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TEN TON SKELETON</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Tradesman Father</strong>. A brutish style which absorbs blows and crashes through defenses.</em><br>
Benefit:Â You have <strong>+1 HP</strong>Â per <strong>template</strong>Â and cannot lose your footing or be moved against your will.<br>
Drawback:Â You weigh ten times as much as normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TWIN SOUL CHAINED</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Revenant Spectre</strong>. An arcane style which channels energy into the duplication of matter.</em><br>
Benefit:Â You may manifest a twin self which acts separately from you, but may not range beyond <strong>10&rsquo;</strong>Â from your body.<br>
Drawback:Â Your twin shares your pool ofÂ <strong>HP</strong>Â - any harm dealt to one of you is mirrored on the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXTRACT UNCOMFORTABLE TOGETHER</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Knight Myrmidon</strong>. A defensive style heavy on feints and parries.</em><br>
Benefit:Â Those you have not acted against cannot bring themselves to harm you directly.<br>
Drawback:Â When wronged, rollÂ <strong>CHA</strong>Â or swear an oath of vengeance. You must fulfill these oaths when able.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>END THE LINEAGE</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the sign of theÂ <strong>Nobleman Gambler</strong>. A style which shifts effortlessly between artful flourishes and sudden, deadly strikes.</em><br>
Benefit:Â You deal <strong>double</strong>Â damage to those in positions of power (mayors, officers, nobility) and <strong>quadruple</strong>Â damage to Kings.<br>
Drawback:Â You <strong>fumble</strong>Â on <strong>d20</strong>Â rolls of <strong>2</strong> as well as <strong>1</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>KICK YOU APART</strong><br>
<em>Associated with the darkness between <strong>constellations</strong>. A grim, utilitarian style focused on lethality with no elegance or beauty to it.</em><br>
Benefit:Â Your feet are <strong>light</strong>Â weapons which deal an additional <strong>+[templates]</strong>Â damage.<br>
Drawback:Â Your <strong>soul</strong>Â is accursed, and will be dragged down to the <strong>underworld</strong>Â by devils upon your death.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>B: <a href="https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2020/05/glog-class-og-wizard-aka-sage.html">Dark Studies</a></strong><br>
You have a <strong>[templates]-in-6</strong> chance to understand ancient writings, witchcraft, curses, and other matters of mystic import immediately upon encountering them. If you fail, you may try again for the same matter upon gaining another template.</p>
<p><strong>B: Secret Tongue</strong><br>
Choose something weird, like minerals, plants, water, beasts, or corpses.Â For deep metaphysical reasons, you may not choose birds.Â You may converse with things of that nature.</p>
<p><strong>C: The Art Realized</strong><br>
You are able to fully manifest your <strong>Art</strong>, gaining her as a <strong>spell</strong>. <strong>MD</strong>Â exhaust only on a <strong>5</strong>Â or <strong>6</strong>Â when invested in her, and when using your <strong>Secret Art</strong>Â ability she can be seen inhabiting your body and enhancing your movements. You may use your <strong>Art</strong>Â to exert non-impacting force (push, lift, carry, throw, etc) on things within a stone&rsquo;s throw as if you were standing next to them, without spending <strong>MD</strong>.</p>
<p>The exact effects of your <strong>Art</strong>Â when cast as a <strong>spell</strong>Â depend on her name and nature:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>STITCH VEINS RED</strong><br>
Animates target corpse of <strong>[dice] * 2</strong>Â or fewer <strong>HD</strong> that used to have blood, raising it as undead for <strong>[sum]</strong>Â hours under your control. If <strong>[dice]</strong>Â is <strong>3 or higher</strong>, the effect is permanent. If <strong>[dice]</strong>Â is <strong>4 or higher</strong>, the undead is sapient and not under your control, though it will be inclined towards gratefulness. Red ribbons extend several feet upward from major veins and arteries, driving it around like a puppet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXCELLENCE IS UNATTAINABLE</strong><br>
Tells you something the target is ashamed of, without alerting them. Higher <strong>[sums]</strong>Â yield more cutting insights.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>POISON NEEDLE HEART</strong><br>
Plunges <strong>[sum]</strong>Â golden needles into the target&rsquo;s heart. Each time they act against you while needles remain, they roll <strong>CHA</strong>Â or take <strong>[dice]</strong>Â damage as one is ripped out. They understand this perfectly, even if you share no methods of communication.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>HUNDRED PACES LIGHTNING</strong><br>
Summons a <strong>horse</strong>Â and <strong>bow</strong>, each made of actinic blue-white radiance. The <strong>horse</strong>Â has <strong>[dice] HD</strong>,Â and the bow conveys a <strong>+[dice]</strong>Â bonus to hit and fires bolts of lightning which deal <strong>[dice]d6</strong>Â damage. Each lasts <strong>[sum]</strong>Â rounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EVERY TOWER FALLS</strong><br>
Topples target structure up to <strong>[dice] * [sum]&rsquo;</strong>Â in its largest dimension.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>SIX POINT AMPHORA</strong><br>
Pours forth <strong>[dice] ^ [sum]</strong>Â gallons of water from your mouth. The water mirrors the composition of the last water you drank.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>UNCARING DEPTHS ENFOLD</strong><br>
Submerges the targeted area <strong>[dice] * 10&rsquo;</strong>Â in diameter (which must contain you) in a hadeal, lightless pocket dimension filled with cold, dark seawater for up to <strong>[sum]</strong>Â hours. You do not need to breathe while in this space, but others do. The portal appears, on the mortal plane, as a pool of the same diameter which accepts anything but light. Unwilling targets may roll <strong>STR</strong>Â to avoid being sucked in when the spell is cast.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>BLUE FLAME HELLION</strong><br>
Transforms you into a <strong>giantÂ ram-headed monkey demon</strong>Â for <strong>[sum]</strong>Â minutes. While the duration lasts, you are <strong>[dice]</strong>Â stories tall and have <strong>[sum] STR</strong>Â and <strong>[sum]</strong>Â times your <strong>HD</strong>Â additional <strong>HP</strong>, which are lost first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TEN TON SKELETON</strong><br>
A second skull erupts from yours and encases you. It extendsÂ <strong>[dice] * [sum]&rsquo;</strong>Â in <strong>radius</strong>Â beyond your own body, has that much <strong>HP</strong>, and is permanent until destroyed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>TWIN SOUL CHAINED</strong><br>
Chains the targeted soul (actual soul, ghost, spell, etc) to the targeted person or object for up to <strong>[sum]</strong>Â hours, so long as each hasÂ <strong>[dice]</strong>Â or fewer <strong>HD</strong>. Chaining a person&rsquo;s soul to their body makes them immune to <strong>death</strong>, provided their body is repaired before the duration runs out. Chaining a spell to something will often prevent it from taking effect at range. Further interactions will be adjudicated on the spot by yourÂ <strong>GM</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>EXTRACT UNCOMFORTABLE TOGETHER</strong><br>
Sets a table for you and up to <strong>[dice]</strong>Â targets, and compels you to conduct a **tea partyÂ **for <strong>[sum]</strong>Â rounds which can only be interrupted by <strong>damage</strong>. If <strong>4+ MD</strong>Â are invested, the effect is permanent until interrupted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>END THE LINEAGE</strong><br>
Permanently abolishes the target touched, erasing them from the present, past, and future and preventing them from rising as undead. Sapient targets may roll <strong>CHA</strong>Â to suffer only partial effects. Works on progressively more powerful targets depending on <strong>MD</strong>Â invested:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>1 MD</strong>Â - Dead or dying.</li>
<li><strong>2 MD</strong>Â - Unnamed.</li>
<li><strong>3 MD</strong>Â - Of little specific metaphysical import.</li>
<li><strong>4 MD</strong>Â - Anything.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="14">
<li><strong>KICK YOU APART</strong><br>
Does not answer to her name, or any other. Her powers are therefore unknown.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point you are also capable of commanding other <strong>spells</strong>, should you persuade one to follow you.</p>
<p><strong>D: Mastery of Life and Death</strong><br>
You are no longer bound to the eternal cycle, and are not affected by <strong>disease</strong>Â or <strong>age</strong>. Unless killed, you will not die before your time. <em>Should</em>Â you die, your next character may appear as a suspiciously similar sibling, clone, or reborn form and begins at the minimum <strong>experience point</strong>Â value necessary to have the <strong>same level</strong>, regardless of class.</p>
<p>In addition, you attract a <strong>student</strong>, who you are expected to teach in the ways of the occult. They are a level <strong>1</strong>Â <strong>Artist</strong>Â of the same Art as yourself, played by the <strong>GM</strong>. Should they die, you will attract a new one within <strong>1d6</strong>Â days.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting Umbrella.</strong>Â Metal fabric, reinforced ribs. A <strong>medium (1d8)</strong>Â weapon that can be unfolded into a shield that grants <strong>cover (+4 AC and saves that make sense)</strong> when held in two hands, but can&rsquo;t be fought with in that configuration. 1 slot.</p>
