<p>Every paladin has a Revelation; a vision which causes them to break with the dogma of the Church and leads them on a divine mission. Every paladin is a prophet, an apostate, and a heretic.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Given three seconds, oxygen, a functioning breath cycle, and at least one hand capable of being cupped, <strong>start a very small fire</strong></li>
<li>Refuse to be <strong>burned</strong> by any fire of not-specifically-malicious intent</li>
<li>Eventually, receive a <strong>shimmering halo</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your character, choose one <strong>holy order</strong> to have learned the traditions of:</p>
<ol>
<li>Choirs Invocant orate and castigate with thundering voices that <strong>cannot be ignored</strong></li>
<li>Inquisitors Avengeant suffer physical harm from speaking untruths, and can <strong>see lies</strong> spoken by others</li>
<li>Templars Contemplative always connect meaningfully with <strong>special moves</strong> that they name and describe</li>
<li>Warminds Scrivener command <strong>angels</strong> with names like <strong>Fireball</strong>, <strong>Lightning</strong>, and <strong>Missile</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Each day, <strong>name</strong> and detail the <strong>portfolio</strong>, <strong>deeds</strong>, <strong>method of martyrdom</strong>, and <strong>ritual observances</strong> of a saint. For each of these you write down, one of the following <strong>prayers</strong> willÂ be answered once that day:</p>
<ol>
<li>O Holy Illuminator, bathe this place in the glory of your Light and make all things visible within itâ€”</li>
<li>O Cleansing Warmth, grant this servant the touch that burns away wounds and illness, and makes all things hale and pureâ€”</li>
<li>O Blinding Radiance, drive my foes before me like shadows before your Light, and undo any Sorceries which they have wroughtâ€”</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="class-witch-true">Class: Witch (True) <a href="#class-witch-true" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><blockquote>
<p>Witches are dark creatures born to followers of the Old Ways who have consorted with spirits, monsters, or beasts. More monster than man, they are an object of both fear and awe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things you can do:Â </p>
<ol>
<li>Melt, burn, or wither away when faced with the object of yourÂ <strong>supernatural weakness</strong></li>
<li>Inflict nonspecific bad luck with theÂ <strong>evil eye</strong>, or very specific bad luck with aÂ <strong>curse</strong>Â if the target has personally wronged you</li>
<li>Sometimes receive actual information from theÂ <strong>GM</strong>Â when youÂ <strong>cast the bones</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your character, choose oneÂ <strong>familiar</strong>Â you are able to create from your flesh:</p>
<ol>
<li>As many <strong>guns</strong>Â as you can carry, which emerge fully loaded</li>
<li>A swarm of your favorite <strong>bugs</strong>, which share your mind</li>
<li>A magicalÂ <strong>friend</strong>, who imposes restrictions and warps your body, but grants you boons</li>
<li>A big <strong>tumor</strong>, which renders diseases harmless to you and easily transmissible to others</li>
</ol>
<p>Each day, choose oneÂ <strong>rhyme</strong>Â you are able to make true byÂ **chantingÂ **it ominously,Â <strong>cackling</strong>, and offering a smallÂ <strong>sacrifice:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Bigger, smaller, I&rsquo;ll decideâ€”your current size I won&rsquo;t abide!</li>
<li>Red and yellow, blue and greenâ€”your true form shall not be seen!</li>
<li>Look at you, hale or sickâ€”your present health, it shall not stick!</li>
<li>All your secrets I shall spyâ€”with my creeping, crawling eye!</li>
<li>With ragged flesh and loyal boneâ€”this corpse shall serve, its will my own!</li>
<li>Lung of toad, essence of bogâ€”I will exhale poison fog!</li>

<h1 id="class-witch-false">Class: Witch (False) <a href="#class-witch-false" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><blockquote>
<p>False witches are scholars, adventurers, thieves, tricksters, explorers, well versed in the magic present in the world and experts in bending it to their use.Â They steal, find, buy, or create magic through ritual, rather than any power held within themselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sustain yourselfÂ **indefinitelyÂ **through a combination of begging, scavenging, foraging, and stealing</li>
<li>Pick shoddy locks in anÂ **instantÂ **and any other type in aÂ <strong>minute or two</strong>, even with makeshift tools</li>
<li><strong>Climb</strong>, without equipment, anything that a properly-equipped person could</li>
<li>ForgeÂ <strong>documents</strong>,Â <strong>seals</strong>, andÂ <strong>signatures</strong>Â given even a passing description of the original</li>
<li>AlwaysÂ have aÂ <strong>small knife</strong>, aÂ **coinÂ **of negligible value, precisely thirteen feet of strongÂ <strong>twine</strong>, a stub ofÂ <strong>chalk</strong>, and a piece ofÂ <strong>charcoal</strong>Â on your person</li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your character, choose oneÂ <strong>physical magic</strong>Â that you have learned the secrets of and acquired oneÂ example of already:</p>
<ol>
<li>Magic swords, which you canÂ **communicate withÂ **at your leisureÂ andÂ <strong>carry any number</strong>Â of without issue</li>
<li>Magic bottles, into which you canÂ **coaxÂ **spiritsÂ orÂ **captureÂ **souls for later releaseÂ to do your bidding</li>
<li>Magic masks, which grant you theÂ <strong>appearance</strong>Â orÂ <strong>abilities</strong>Â of the person or beast you made them from</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="class-gutter-knight">Class: Gutter Knight <a href="#class-gutter-knight" class="anchor">ðŸ”—</a></h1><blockquote>
<p>Gutter knights are noble scions, who journey and commit acts of conspicuous heroism as a coming-of-age ritual before eventually hanging up their cloak and returning to take their place in the gentry; theoretically humbled and made wiser by their experience.Â </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things you can do:Â </p>
<ol>
<li>NotÂ possess any amount of <strong>currency</strong>, nor anything else beyond a <strong>mount</strong>, <strong>saddle</strong>, <strong>riding tack</strong>, and whatever you can <strong>carry on your person</strong></li>
<li>Rely on your <strong>family name</strong>Â to secure respect, food, lodging, and <strong>knightly quests</strong> in any settlement large enough to have a mayor</li>
<li>Defeat any single person, most duos of people, and especially pusillanimous trios and quartets in a fairÂ <strong>contest of strength or arms</strong></li>
<li>Take a blowÂ that was meant for one of your <strong>allies within arm&rsquo;s reach</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you create your character or complete a <strong>knightly quest</strong>, sew a new <strong>patch-favor</strong>Â to your cloak with a thematic ability which can be used <strong>once</strong>Â per day:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Torch</strong>, for rescuing a peasant boy from a cave. Sets something on fire.</li>
<li><strong>Paper soldier</strong>, for defending a library from book-burners. Grapples with the strength of five strong men.</li>
<li><strong>Mighty oak</strong>, for saving a dryad&rsquo;s grove from loggers. Makes a big tree, very fast.</li>
<li><strong>Trick rope</strong>, for rescuing a street performer from the gallows. Creates 50&rsquo; of animate rope that obeys your commands.</li>
<li><strong>Windmill</strong>, for putting out a village fire. Blows anything not securely anchored to the ground away with a gust of wind.</li>
<li><strong>Conch</strong>, for extricating a nymph from a fishing net. Summons a pack of friendly sea lions.</li>
<li>&amp;c, &amp;c. This is just a starting list, not exhaustive.</li>
</ol>
